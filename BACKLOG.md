# Backlog

Future ideas and parking lot items for the P0STMAN project.

## Feature Ideas

- Voice agent avatar selection UI (Simli has multiple faces available)
- Voice agent language selection persistence
- Lead collection analytics dashboard
- Kling AI integration for pre-recorded video content (marketing assets, case study videos, motion-controlled demos) - complements Simli for non-realtime use cases

## Technical Improvements

- Fix Vercel API route TypeScript errors - `@vercel/node` module not found during builds
- Replace remaining P0STMAN references in static HTML files (public/industries/, public/locations/, public/guides/, etc.)
- Code splitting for main bundle (currently 3.6MB, warning in build)

## Content Updates

- Update location from Dubai to London in various pages/prompts
- Review case study content for accuracy

## Low Priority

- Remove unused voice agent config files if deprecated
- Clean up legacy ElevenLabs/OpenAI references in comments
