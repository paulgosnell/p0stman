**Meta Title:** Lovable to Production | Take Your Lovable Prototype Live | P0STMAN

**Meta Description:** Built something in Lovable.dev but hit a wall? I take Lovable prototypes to production — fast. Vibe coding expert since 2024.

## Hero

**Headline:**
Built something in Lovable. Now you need it to actually work.

**Subhead:**
Lovable is brilliant for prototyping. But production needs proper architecture, security, and scale. I've shipped dozens of AI-prototyped apps to production. Let's get yours live.

## You Got This Far

### Lovable helped you visualise your idea

You described what you wanted. Lovable built it. You've got a working prototype that proves your concept.

But now you're hitting limits:

- **Supabase is getting messy** — Tables you didn't plan for, relationships that don't quite work
- **The UI breaks on mobile** — Or on certain browsers, or when users do unexpected things
- **You need custom features** — Payment flows, integrations, logic that Lovable can't figure out
- **It's slow** — Works fine for you, but won't handle 100 users
- **You can't export the code** — Lovable doesn't let you take it elsewhere

This is normal. Lovable optimises for speed and validation, not production.

## What Lovable Does Well

### And where it stops

**Lovable excels at:**
- Rapid UI generation
- Supabase integration for basic data
- Visualising ideas quickly
- Non-technical founders getting something working

**Lovable struggles with:**
- Complex business logic
- Custom payment flows
- Third-party integrations
- Performance at scale
- Code you can maintain long-term
- Mobile responsiveness edge cases

The tool did its job. It validated your idea in days instead of months.

Now you need someone who can build the real thing.

## Why I Understand Lovable

### I've been vibe coding since before the term existed

When Bolt.new launched in October 2024, I was one of the first to push it to production. Full CRM with database, Stripe, auth — live.

The Bolt CEO reached out. Asked how I'd done it.

I've since built with Lovable, Replit, and every major vibe coding tool. I know exactly where they break and why.

More importantly: I know how to take what you've built and turn it into something that scales.

## How I Work With Lovable Projects

### Your prototype becomes the spec

1. **You send me your Lovable project** — I review what you've built, what works, what doesn't

2. **I understand your intent** — Not just what's there, but what you were trying to achieve

3. **I rebuild it properly** — Same functionality, proper architecture. Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe — built to scale.

4. **You get production code you own** — Deployed, documented, maintainable. Yours forever.

### Why rebuild instead of fix?

Lovable generates code optimised for speed, not maintainability. Trying to retrofit production requirements into that codebase takes longer and costs more than starting fresh.

Your prototype is the spec. I use it to build something solid.

## Common Lovable-to-Production Projects

### What I typically build from Lovable prototypes

- **SaaS dashboards** — Admin panels, user management, analytics
- **Booking platforms** — Calendars, payments, notifications
- **Marketplaces** — Multi-sided platforms with complex logic
- **AI-powered apps** — Chat interfaces, recommendation engines, automation
- **Customer portals** — Secure access, data management, integrations

If you built it in Lovable, I can probably take it to production.

## FAQ

**Can you just fix my Lovable code?**
Lovable doesn't export clean code — and even if it did, retrofitting production requirements takes longer than rebuilding. I use your prototype as the spec, not the foundation.

**Do I lose what I built?**
No. Your Lovable prototype stays exactly as is. I build something new based on what you've created. You can keep using Lovable for testing while I build production.

**What if I'm still iterating in Lovable?**
That's fine. Lock in the core features you know you want, and I'll build those. You can keep experimenting in Lovable for new ideas.

**How is your approach different from other developers?**
I actually use these tools. I know Lovable, Bolt, Replit from the inside. Most developers look at vibe-coded projects with confusion or disdain. I look at them as validated specs.
