**Meta Title:** Hire a Developer After Prototyping | Lovable, Bolt, Replit | P0STMAN

**Meta Description:** Built a prototype in Lovable, Bolt, or Replit? Here's what to look for when hiring a developer to take it to production.

## Hero

**Headline:**
You've built a prototype. Now you need the right developer.

**Subhead:**
Not every developer understands vibe-coded projects. Here's what to look for — and why it matters.

## The Wrong Developer Will Waste Your Money

### Most developers don't understand what you've built

You show them your Lovable project. They look confused.

You explain you built it with AI. They look skeptical.

They quote you weeks of work to "fix" something they don't really understand.

This happens constantly. Traditional developers see vibe-coded projects as:
- Messy code that needs rewriting (true, but they don't know why)
- Amateur work (wrong — you validated an idea)
- Something to judge rather than learn from

You need someone who actually uses these tools.

## What to Look For

### The right developer for your prototype

**1. They actually use vibe coding tools**
Not "I've heard of Bolt" — actually uses them. Knows the strengths. Knows the limits. Understands why you got stuck where you did.

**2. They respect your prototype**
Your prototype isn't garbage. It's compressed requirements. It's validated assumptions. The right developer sees it as valuable input, not a mess to clean up.

**3. They start fresh (and explain why)**
The right approach is usually to rebuild, not fix. AI-generated code optimises for speed, not maintainability. A developer who wants to "continue where you left off" probably doesn't understand the code.

**4. They've shipped production**
Prototyping and production are different skills. Make sure they've actually deployed apps that handle real users, real data, real edge cases.

**5. They work fast**
If they're estimating weeks for basic features, they're probably not using AI-first workflows. The same tools that helped you build fast should help them build fast too.

## Red Flags

### Developers who will waste your time

❌ **"This code is a mess, I'll need to rewrite everything"**
True, but if they're saying it with judgment rather than understanding, they won't build what you actually want.

❌ **"I've never used Lovable/Bolt but I can figure it out"**
They'll spend your money learning. Find someone who already knows.

❌ **"Let me continue building on what you have"**
Vibe-coded projects aren't designed for continuation. This will cost more and take longer than rebuilding.

❌ **"This will take 3 months"**
For a prototype-to-production project? Red flag. AI-first development is faster.

❌ **"I don't believe in AI coding tools"**
Then they're not the right fit for your project. You need someone who lives in this ecosystem.

## Questions to Ask

### Before you hire anyone

1. **Have you shipped production apps from Lovable/Bolt/Replit prototypes before?**
   Look for specific examples, not theoretical answers.

2. **Will you rebuild or continue my existing code?**
   Rebuild is usually right. If they say continue, ask why.

3. **How do you use AI in your own workflow?**
   The best developers for this work use AI tools daily, not occasionally.

4. **What's your timeline for a working demo?**
   Should be 1-2 weeks for most projects. Longer means they're not using AI-first workflows.

5. **Can you show me similar projects you've taken to production?**
   Proof matters more than promises.

## Why I'm the Right Fit

### My background with vibe coding

I was vibe coding before it had a name.

**October 2024:** Bolt.new launches. While others make landing pages, I ship a full CRM. Database, Stripe, auth, deployed live.

**The result:** Bolt's CEO reaches out. Says they have power users, and then there's me. I consult with their team on how I pushed their tool further than anyone else.

Since then:
- Built production apps from Lovable prototypes
- Built production apps from Replit Agent projects
- Helped dozens of founders bridge the prototype-to-production gap
- 20+ years of product development experience
- 1000+ products shipped

I don't look at your prototype with confusion. I look at it with recognition. I know exactly where you got stuck because I've been there.

## How I Work

### From your prototype to production

**Step 1: You send me your project**
Lovable link, Bolt.new project, Replit URL — whatever you've built.

**Step 2: I review and scope**
I'll tell you what works, what's missing, and exactly what it'll take to go production.

**Step 3: Rebuild with proper architecture**
Your prototype becomes the spec. I build production-ready code using Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe.

**Step 4: Deploy and support**
Deployed, documented, yours. 30-day bug-free guarantee.

## Timeline & Pricing

### What to expect

**Phase 1: Working Demo**
- 1 week
- $5k-8k
- Your prototype rebuilt properly, ready for testing

**Phase 2: Production Launch**
- 2-3 weeks
- $10k-25k
- Deployed, scalable, customer-ready

This is faster than most developers because:
- I understand vibe-coded projects (no learning curve)
- I use AI-first workflows myself (same speed you experienced)
- I've done this many times before (no surprises)

## Compare Your Options

### What different developers will do

| Approach | Timeline | Cost | Result |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| **Traditional agency** | 8-12 weeks | $30k-80k | Overbuilt, slow, expensive |
| **Freelancer who doesn't get it** | 4-6 weeks | $15k-25k | Frustrated process, mixed results |
| **Continue in Lovable/Bolt** | Forever | Credits + time | Never production-ready |
| **Developer who knows vibe coding** | 3-4 weeks | $10k-25k | Production-ready, fast, understood |

I'm the last option. Fast because I understand the tools. Affordable because I use AI. Reliable because I've done it before.

## FAQ

**What if I want to stay with my current developer?**
If they're delivering, great. This page is for people who've struggled to find the right fit.

**Can you just consult instead of build?**
I can review your prototype and give you a clear scope. But I prefer to build — that's where I add the most value.

**What if my prototype is really basic?**
That's fine. Even a simple Lovable demo tells me what you want. I'll build from there.

**What if I'm still iterating on the prototype?**
Lock in the core features you know you want. I'll build those while you keep experimenting.
