## Bio / About Section

### Short Version (if character-limited)

Built something in Bolt, Lovable, or Replit? I take AI prototypes to production.

I was vibe coding before it had a name. In October 2024, I shipped a full CRM on Bolt.new — database, Stripe, auth, live — when everyone else was making landing pages. The CEO reached out to ask how.

20+ years building products. 1000+ shipped. Now I help founders who've hit the prototype wall get to launch.

Your prototype isn't a failure. It's discovery. I use it as the spec and build something production-ready in weeks, not months.

• Bolt.new power user since launch
• Lovable, Replit, Claude Code, Cursor
• Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe
• 1-week demos, 3-week production launches
• 30-day bug-free guarantee

Send me your project. I'll tell you what it takes to go live.

### Long Version (if space allows)

**The Short Version:**
I take AI-built prototypes to production. Bolt, Lovable, Replit — I've used them all and know exactly where they break.

**The Backstory:**
In October 2024, Bolt.new launched. While others made landing pages, I built a full CRM — database, Stripe payments, user auth, deployed live.

The Bolt CEO reached out. Said they had power users, and then there was me. Nobody else had shipped production on their platform yet.

I've been building products for 20+ years. 1000+ shipped. The skills that make AI coding tools work — clear communication, context engineering, systematic thinking — are the same skills I've practiced for two decades.

**What I Do Now:**
Founders build prototypes in Lovable or Bolt. They validate their idea. Then they hit walls: scale, security, features the AI can't handle.

That's where I come in.

Your prototype isn't a mess to clean up. It's compressed requirements. Validated assumptions. Months of discovery done in days.

I use your prototype as the spec and rebuild with proper architecture. Same functionality, production-ready code.

**Timeline:**
• Working demo: 1 week ($5k-8k)
• Production launch: 2-3 weeks ($10k-25k)

**Stack:**
• AI: Claude Code, Cursor, Bolt.new, Lovable
• Production: Next.js, React, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe

**Guarantee:**
30 days bug-free. I don't build and ghost.

Send me your Bolt or Lovable project. I'll tell you exactly what it takes.

## Response Templates

### When responding to vibe coding project posts:

**Template 1 (Direct):**
"I've been building with [Bolt/Lovable] since launch — I was one of the first to ship production on Bolt.new back in October 2024. I know exactly where these tools hit their limits.

Your prototype isn't wasted work — it's the spec. I'd rebuild with proper architecture (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel) in [X weeks].

Happy to review your project and give you a clear scope. What have you built so far?"

**Template 2 (Empathetic):**
"This sounds like a classic prototype-to-production gap — totally normal when using AI coding tools.

I've shipped dozens of production apps from Lovable and Bolt prototypes. The pattern is always the same: the prototype validates the idea, then you need proper architecture to scale.

I'd use your existing build as the spec and rebuild production-ready. Usually 1 week to working demo, 2-3 weeks to launch.

Want to share what you've got? I can give you a clear path forward."
