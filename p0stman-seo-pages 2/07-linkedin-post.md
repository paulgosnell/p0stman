# LinkedIn Post: Vibe Coding Origin Story

**Purpose:** Establish credibility, attract vibe coding founders, drive inbound

## Post Content

I was vibe coding before it had a name.

Back in October 2024, Bolt.new launched. I was one of the first to push it hard — not just prototypes, but a full CRM with database, Stripe payments, auth, the lot. Shipped it live.

The CEO reached out. Asked how I'd done it. Said they had power users, and then there was me. Nobody had shipped a production app on their platform yet.

Turns out 20 years of talking to designers, developers, clients, and stakeholders had trained me for this moment. The way I describe features. The way I report bugs. The way I give context. That's what we now call prompt engineering and context engineering. I was just doing it naturally.

I've watched vibe coding explode since then. Lovable, Replit, Base44 — non-technical founders building things that would've cost $50k three years ago. It's genuinely exciting.

But here's the pattern I keep seeing:

Founders build something real in Bolt or Lovable. They validate the idea. They hit a wall. The prototype works but won't scale. Or breaks in weird ways. Or needs features the tools can't handle.

Then they come looking for someone like me.

Here's what I tell them:

Your prototype isn't a failure. It's discovery.

You now know exactly what you want. You've visualised it. You've tested it. That's months of requirements gathering — done.

I don't "fix" vibe code projects. I start fresh. It's faster, cheaper, and cleaner than trying to reverse-engineer what Bolt or Lovable generated.

But I understand the tools you used. I know where they break. I know why you got stuck. Because I've pushed them further than most.

If you've built something in Lovable or Bolt and you're ready to go production — let's talk.

Your prototype did its job. Now let's build the real thing.
