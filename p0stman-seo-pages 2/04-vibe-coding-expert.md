**Meta Title:** Vibe Coding Expert | Professional AI-Assisted Development | P0STMAN

**Meta Description:** Vibe coding before it had a name. First to ship production on Bolt.new. 20+ years building products, now with AI. I turn prototypes into production.

## Hero

**Headline:**
Vibe coding before it had a name.

**Subhead:**
I've been building with AI coding tools since they launched. Shipped production apps when others were still making landing pages. 20 years of product experience meets cutting-edge AI development.

**CTA:** Let's Build Something

## The Origin Story

### October 2024: Bolt.new launches

Everyone was making landing pages and simple demos.

I built a full CRM.

Database. Stripe payments. User authentication. Deployed live.

Eric, Bolt's CEO, reached out. Said they had power users, and then there was me. Nobody else had shipped a production app on their platform.

I spent weeks consulting with the Bolt team. Helped them understand how I'd pushed their tool further than expected. Almost launched the Bolt Builders community with them.

That was before "vibe coding" was even a term.

## Why I Was Ready

### 20 years of the right experience

Turns out, building products for two decades trains you perfectly for AI-assisted development.

**Prompt engineering?** I'd been writing clear, contextual briefs for designers and developers for years. Describing features in language everyone understands. Reporting bugs with precise reproduction steps.

**Context engineering?** I'd been doing that every time I onboarded a new team member or handed off a project. Documenting systems so others could pick them up.

**Working with AI?** It's like working with a brilliant junior developer who needs clear direction. I've managed hundreds of those.

The skills that make AI coding tools work are the same skills that make product development work. I just happened to have 20 years of practice.

## The Tools I Use

### Current stack

**AI Coding:**
- Claude Code (primary)
- Cursor
- Bolt.new (since launch)
- Lovable
- Replit Agent

**LLMs:**
- Anthropic Claude (Sonnet 4.5, Opus)
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Google Gemini
- Grok

**Development:**
- Next.js
- React
- Supabase
- Vercel
- Stripe

**Creative:**
- Midjourney
- Runway
- ElevenLabs

I don't just use these tools occasionally. I live in them. Daily.

## What Makes Me Different

### From other vibe coders

Most vibe coders are:
- Non-technical founders learning to build
- Hobbyists experimenting with AI
- Developers trying out new tools

I'm:
- 20+ years shipping products
- 1000+ products delivered
- Deep understanding of architecture, scale, security
- Builder of chilledsites.com (multi-model code generation platform)
- Recognised by the founders of these tools

**The difference:** I know where the tools excel and where they break. I can push them further than most. And when they hit their limits, I know how to build the rest properly.

## What Vibe Coding Can't Do

### Being honest about the limits

Vibe coding is incredible for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Idea validation
- Visual exploration
- First drafts of functionality

Vibe coding struggles with:
- Complex business logic
- Security at production level
- Performance at scale
- Long-term maintainability
- Edge cases and error handling

The tools are getting better. Fast. But today, production still needs human expertise layered on top.

That's where I come in.

---

## The P0STMAN Approach

### AI-first, human-validated

Everything I build uses AI tools. Research, planning, code, documentation — AI throughout.

But every output gets human validation. I review, test, refine. The AI does the heavy lifting. I make sure it's actually right.

This gives you:
- Speed of AI (40% faster than traditional agencies)
- Quality of experience (20 years of knowing what "good" looks like)
- Reliability of human judgment (someone accountable for the result)

---

## Production From Prototypes

### My specialty

The most common project I take on:

1. Founder builds something in Bolt, Lovable, or Replit
2. Prototype works but won't scale
3. They need someone who understands both worlds
4. I take the prototype as the spec and build production

Your prototype isn't a failure. It's discovery. It's requirements gathering done in days instead of months.

I use what you've built to understand what you want. Then I build something that actually delivers it.

## FAQ

**What's the difference between you and other vibe coders?**
Experience. I've shipped 1000+ products over 20 years. I know architecture, scale, security. Most vibe coders are learning to build. I already know — AI just makes me faster.

**Can you teach me to vibe code better?**
Not currently offering training, but I'm considering it. For now, I build. Maybe teaching later.

**Do you look down on vibe coding tools?**
Opposite. I think they're revolutionary. I was early because I recognised how powerful they were. I just also know their limits.

**What if I want you to just improve my vibe-coded project?**
Usually rebuilding is faster and cheaper. But send it over — if building on what you have makes sense, I'll tell you.
