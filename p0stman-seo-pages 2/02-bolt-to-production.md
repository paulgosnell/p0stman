**Meta Title:** Bolt to Production | Take Your Bolt.new App Live | P0STMAN

**Meta Description:** Built something in Bolt.new but need it production-ready? I was one of Bolt's first power users — shipped a full CRM before anyone else. Let's get yours live.

## Hero

**Headline:**
I shipped production on Bolt before anyone else. Now I can do it for you.

**Subhead:**
In October 2024, I built a full CRM on Bolt.new — database, Stripe, auth, deployed live. The CEO reached out to ask how. I've been pushing these tools to their limits ever since.

## The Bolt Story

### I was there from day one

When Bolt.new launched, I was one of the first to go beyond landing pages.

I built Chilled CRM — a full customer relationship management system with:
- Supabase database
- Stripe payment integration
- User authentication
- Production deployment

Eric, Bolt's CEO, reached out personally. Said they had power users, and then there was me. Nobody else had shipped a production app on their platform at that point.

I spent time consulting with the Bolt team, helping them understand how I'd done it. Almost launched the Bolt Builders community with them.

Point is: I know Bolt inside and out. I know where it excels. I know exactly where it breaks.

## Where Bolt Breaks

### The limits you've probably hit

Bolt is the most developer-friendly vibe coding tool. But it still has ceilings:

- **Complex state management** — Multi-step flows, conditional logic, real-time updates
- **Backend complexity** — Bolt handles basic CRUD but struggles with complex business logic
- **Third-party integrations** — Payment flows, external APIs, webhooks
- **Performance at scale** — Fine for demos, struggles under real load
- **Code maintainability** — Generated code is functional but not architected for long-term development

If you've hit these walls, you're not doing anything wrong. You've just reached the edge of what the tool was designed for.

## What Bolt Does Right

### And why your prototype matters

**Bolt excels at:**
- Rapid full-stack scaffolding
- React + Tailwind generation
- Supabase integration
- Letting developers see and edit the code
- Fast iteration on UI and basic features

Your Bolt prototype isn't a failure. It's a validated spec.

You've proven the idea works. You've figured out what you want. That's months of discovery — compressed into days.

Now you need someone who can take it the rest of the way.

## How I Work With Bolt Projects

### From prototype to production

1. **You share your Bolt project** — I review the code, understand what you've built, identify the gaps

2. **I map out what's needed** — Security, scale, integrations, features Bolt couldn't handle

3. **I rebuild with proper architecture** — Same functionality, production-ready code. Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe.

4. **You get code you own** — Deployed, documented, maintainable. Full GitHub access.

### Why rebuild instead of continuing in Bolt?

Bolt generates functional code, but it's not architected for production. The patterns work for prototyping — they don't work for scale, security, and long-term maintenance.

I use your Bolt project as the spec. Then I build something solid.

## What I've Built From Bolt Prototypes

### Real examples

- **Chilled CRM** — Full CRM system, my original Bolt build that got the CEO's attention
- **Booking platforms** — Calendar, payments, notifications, multi-user
- **SaaS dashboards** — Admin panels, user management, analytics
- **AI-integrated apps** — Chat interfaces, workflow automation
- **Marketplaces** — Multi-sided platforms with complex transaction logic

If you've built it in Bolt, I can take it to production.

## The Bolt Advantage

### Why Bolt projects are easier to work with

Compared to other vibe coding tools, Bolt has an edge: you can see and edit the code.

This means:
- I can review exactly what you've built
- I understand your intent from the code itself
- The transition to production is cleaner

Lovable and Replit hide more of the complexity. Bolt exposes it. That makes my job easier — and your project faster to ship.

## FAQ

**Can you just continue building in Bolt?**
I could, but you'd hit the same ceilings again. Bolt is great for 0-to-prototype. Production needs different foundations.

**Do you use Bolt in your own workflow?**
I did extensively in 2024. Now I primarily use Claude Code and Cursor — more control, better for production work. But I still understand Bolt deeply.

**What if my Bolt project is almost working?**
Send it over. If it genuinely makes sense to build on what you have, I'll tell you. But usually, a clean rebuild is faster and cheaper.

**Can you help me understand where I went wrong?**
You didn't go wrong. You used the tool correctly — you just reached its limits. That's exactly what the tool is for: getting to the point where you know what you need.
