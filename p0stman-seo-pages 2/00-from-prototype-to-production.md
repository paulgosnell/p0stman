## Hero

**Headline:**
Built a prototype. Now what?

**Subhead:**
Bolt, Lovable, Replit — these tools are incredible for validation. But production needs something more. I've been vibe coding since before it had a name. I know exactly where you got stuck.

## The Problem

### You've hit the wall

You built something real. A working prototype that proves your idea has legs.

But now:
- The database is getting messy
- Auth breaks in weird ways
- You need features the AI can't handle
- The code works but won't scale
- You've spent 40 hours prompting and you're further from launch than when you started

This is the prototype-to-production gap. It's where most vibe coding projects stall.

And it's completely normal.

---

## The Reframe

### Your prototype isn't a failure. It's discovery.

That thing you built? It's not wasted work.

You've visualised your vision. Tested assumptions. Figured out what you actually want.

That's months of traditional requirements gathering — done in days.

The prototype did its job. Now you need someone who can take it from here.

## Why Me

### I was vibe coding before it had a name

In October 2024, Bolt.new launched. I was one of the first power users.

While others made landing pages, I shipped a full CRM — database, Stripe payments, auth, the works. Live. Production.

The Bolt CEO reached out. Asked how I'd done it. Said they had power users, and then there was me.

20 years of building products had trained me for this. The way I describe features, report bugs, and give context is what we now call prompt engineering and context engineering. I was doing it before the terms existed.

**I've built production apps with:**
- Bolt.new (since launch day, October 2024)
- Lovable
- Replit
- Claude Code
- Cursor

I know where these tools break. I know why you got stuck. I know how to get past it.

## How I Work

### I don't fix vibe code. I start fresh.

It's faster, cheaper, and cleaner to rebuild than reverse-engineer what Bolt or Lovable generated.

AI-generated code optimises for speed, not maintainability. Fixing it creates more problems than starting with solid foundations.

**The process:**

1. **Review your prototype** — I look at what you built, understand the intent, identify what's missing

2. **Start fresh with proper architecture** — Your prototype becomes the spec. I build production-ready code that scales.

3. **Ship fast** — AI-first workflows mean 40% faster than traditional agencies. MVPs in 6 days. Production apps in 3 weeks.

4. **Stay involved** — 30-day bug-free guarantee. I don't build and ghost.

## FAQ

**Can't you just fix my existing code?**
I could, but it would take longer and cost more. Vibe-coded apps aren't built for maintainability. Retrofitting production requirements creates more problems than starting fresh.

**What if my prototype is really close?**
Send it over. If building on it makes sense, I'll tell you. But 90% of the time, a clean rebuild is faster.

**What tech stack do you use?**
Next.js, React, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe. Modern, scalable, maintainable. Same tools under the hood — just architected properly.

**How fast can you start?**
Usually within a week. Sometimes sooner.
