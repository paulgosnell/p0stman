// ... 30 total industries mapped
```

'dubai': 'uae,middle-east' → FAB Bank, DoH Health, Etihad, Arabian Malls, Al Arabiya
'london': 'global' → All global case studies
// ... 8 locations mapped
```

**Comparisons → Tech:**

// ... 9 comparisons with selective tech proof
```

## Expected Impact

### Traffic (Based on GSC Data Analysis)

**Current Performance (Oct 12-30):**
- 523 impressions/day
- 2 clicks/day (0.38% CTR)
- "livekit vs elevenlabs" has 28.12% CTR (top performer)

**Projected Performance (30 days):**
- 2,500+ impressions/day (+378%)
- 25-40 clicks/day (+1,150%)
- Improved CTR from position 6-10 pages moving to top 3

### Conversion Goals

**Conservative Estimates:**
- **Page visitors:** 25-40/day
- **Conversion rate:** 2-3% (case study views → consultation requests)
- **Expected leads:** 1-2 qualified leads/day
- **Monthly leads:** 30-60 qualified consultations

**Optimistic Scenario:**
- If traffic hits 2,500 impressions with 3% CTR = 75 visitors/day
- At 3% conversion = 2-3 leads/day
- Monthly: 60-90 qualified leads

## How It Works

### For Visitors:

1. **Arrives at programmatic page** (via Google search)
2. **Reads content** (pain points, solutions, FAQs)
3. **Sees relevant case studies** (6 random, filtered by their context)
4. **Views case study details** (real projects with real results)
5. **Reads CTA** ("We've built this for [your industry]. Let us build yours.")
6. **Clicks "Schedule Free Consultation"** → Lead captured!

### JavaScript Logic:

```javascript
// On page load:
1. Read data-industries/data-region/data-tech from section
2. Filter caseStudies array by matching tags
3. Shuffle filtered results
4. Take 6 random case studies
5. Render cards with links to full case studies
6. Populate CTA with dynamic industry name
7. Show tech proof if data-tech matches
```

## Key Success Factors

   - Test CTA placement (top vs bottom)
   - Test industry-specific vs generic CTAs
