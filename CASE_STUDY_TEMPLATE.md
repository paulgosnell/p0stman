## QUICK TIPS

✓ **Longer descriptions are BETTER** (250-400 chars shows depth)
✓ **Use specific numbers** (€5K, 95%, 300%, <500ms)
✓ **Comparison statements create impact** ("vs. traditional €500K...")
✓ **Multi-sentence narratives work well** (2-3 sentences for descriptions)

✗ **Don't exceed 130 chars** on benefit stat descriptions (mobile overflow!)
✗ **Don't write titles over 50 chars** (feels cramped)
✗ **Don't write challenge descriptions under 150 chars** (not enough detail)
