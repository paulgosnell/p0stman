## Generator Script

### `/scripts/generate-locations.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/generate-locations.js
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads location data from `/data/locations.json`
2. Reads templates from `/templates/`
3. Generates individual location pages with:
   - Location-specific content
   - Schema markup (Service + FAQPage)
   - Local compliance context
   - Regional pain points and benefits
4. Generates hub page grouping locations by region
5. Creates sitemap with all location URLs

**Output:**
- 8 location pages in `/public/locations/{slug}/index.html`
- 1 hub page in `/public/locations/index.html`
- Sitemap for merging into main sitemap

## Schema Markup

Each location page includes:

**Service Schema:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Service",
  "name": "AI Voice Agents in Dubai, UAE",
  "areaServed": "Dubai, UAE",
  "offers": {
    "price": "5000",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
```

**FAQ Schema:**
- How much does it cost in {location}?
- Do you understand {location} regulations?
- Can AI handle local language/dialects?
- How long to build?
- Can you integrate with local systems?

## SEO Strategy

**Target Keywords:**
- "AI voice agents {city}"
- "AI development {country}"
- "{location} AI solutions"
- "AI agents {region}"

**Local Advantages:**
- Regional compliance (GDPR, PDPL, CCPA)
- Language/dialect support (Arabic, British English, etc.)
- Time zone awareness
- Local payment systems
- Cultural intelligence

## Adding New Locations

1. Add new location to `/data/locations.json`:
```json
{
  "slug": "singapore",
  "name": "Singapore",
  "region": "Asia Pacific",
  "metaTitle": "AI Voice Agents Singapore | P0STMAN",
  "metaDescription": "...",
  "heroH1": "AI Voice Agents & Development in Singapore",
  "heroSubtext": "...",
  "painPoints": [...],
  "benefits": [...],
  "stats": "...",
  "localPresence": "...",
  "cta": "Build your Singapore-based AI agent"
}
```

2. Run generator:
```bash
node scripts/generate-locations.js
```

3. Update main sitemap manually or regenerate

## Updating Templates
