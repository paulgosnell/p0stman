Project Name: Luxury Travel Sweden — Cinematic Editorial Web Experience

Tone & Style:
	•	Cinematic, aspirational, editorial — think Monocle × Condé Nast Traveller.

	•	Typography: elegant serif for headlines, clean sans for body copy.
	•	Color palette: black / white / greys with muted accent tones drawn from nature (forest green, slate blue) or photography.
	•	All visuals should feel original, curated, and non-stock (or bespoke/licensed).
