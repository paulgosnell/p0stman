🔑 Feature Priorities (MVP)

Must-have for trust and utility:
	•	Topic Hubs with standardized structure
	•	Evidence Score badges on every product card
	•	Neutral disclosure footer on every page
	•	Search and browse by categories
	•	Clear About/Trust page

Nice-to-have but maybe v1.5:
	•	Community outcome submissions (could start with “seeded” examples)
	•	User accounts (save stacks, alerts)
	•	Early membership tier

⸻

👉 In short, the MVP site = Home + Categories Grid + 3–4 Topic Hubs + Evidence Methodology + Trust Manifesto + Product Listings with evidence-first sort + transparent links.
