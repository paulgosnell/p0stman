# ü§ñ AI Instructions for Mamori Design System

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - READ FIRST

**MANDATORY ALIGNMENT**: Any work within the `/mamori` folder MUST be aligned with the Design Language System defined in `dls.html`. This is non-negotiable.

---

## üéØ Primary Reference Document

**`dls.html`** is the single source of truth for:
- Visual design standards
- Component specifications
- Color palette (Nordic theme)
- Typography scales
- Glass morphism effects
- Animation patterns
- Code implementation examples

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Design System Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Nordic Minimalism**: Scandinavian-inspired clean aesthetics
- **Glass Morphism**: Backdrop blur effects and translucent layers
- **Protective Design**: User-first, accessible interfaces
- **Mathematical Precision**: Apple-quality attention to detail

### Color Palette (MUST USE)
- **Aurora**: `#0EA5E9` (Primary blue)
- **Fjord**: `#10B981` (Deep green)
- **Glacier**: `#64748B` (Cool gray)
- **Birch**: `#F59E0B` (Warm amber)
- **Neutrals**: White, Cloud, Stone, Ash, Graphite

### Typography
- Fluid scaling with clamp() functions
- SF Pro Display/Text font family
- Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600)

## üìã Mandatory Checklist

Before creating ANY new file or component:

- [ ] Review `dls.html` design patterns
- [ ] Use established color variables
- [ ] Follow glass morphism styling
- [ ] Implement Nordic design principles  
- [ ] Ensure accessibility standards
- [ ] Match animation/interaction patterns
- [ ] Use consistent typography scales

---

## üö´ Forbidden Actions

**NEVER:**
- Create components that don't match DLS standards
- Use colors outside the Nordic palette
- Ignore glass morphism patterns
- Skip accessibility considerations
- Deviate from established typography
- Create inconsistent interaction patterns

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Every new addition must:
1. **Visually harmonize** with existing DLS components
2. **Follow Nordic minimalism** principles
3. **Implement glass morphism** where appropriate
4. **Maintain accessibility** standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. **Use established patterns** from `dls.html`

---

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Study** `dls.html` thoroughly
2. **Extract** relevant patterns/styles
3. **Implement** new features using DLS standards
4. **Test** visual consistency
5. **Verify** accessibility compliance

---

## üìû Emergency Protocol

If you encounter conflicting requirements:
1. **DLS alignment takes priority**
2. Ask for clarification from user
3. Propose DLS-compliant alternatives
4. Never break design system consistency

**Remember: The Mamori Design System is protective by nature. Protect its integrity at all costs.**
