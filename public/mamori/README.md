# Mamori Design System
*A premium digital design language inspired by Scandinavian minimalism and Apple's precision*

## Philosophy

Mamori embodies the intersection of Scandinavian functionality and Apple's refined digital craftsmanship. Every element serves a purpose, every space breathes with intention, and every interaction feels effortlessly human.

**Core Values:**
- **Calm over Chaos** - Visual serenity through generous whitespace and muted palettes
- **Function over Form** - Beauty emerges from purposeful design, not decoration  
- **Precision over Perfection** - Thoughtful details that enhance without overwhelming
- **Timeless over Trendy** - Design that ages gracefully like fine Scandinavian furniture

## Design Principles

### 1. Generous Breathing Room
Every element needs space to exist. Cramped layouts create visual anxiety - we choose calm expansiveness.

### 2. Soft Geometry
Hard edges feel aggressive. Our rounded corners (16px+) and diffuse shadows create approachable, friendly interfaces.

### 3. Muted Confidence  
Colors whisper rather than shout. Our palette draws from Nordic landscapes - stone, sage, clay, and endless sky.

### 4. Typography as Architecture
Text creates the structural foundation. Clear hierarchies guide users naturally through content.

### 5. Subtle Motion
Interactions feel fluid and natural. Spring physics and gentle easing create delightful micro-moments.
