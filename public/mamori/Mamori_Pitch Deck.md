# Health Marketplace Pitch Deck 

# Slide Outline

*A neutral, evidence‑first buyer’s guide \+ referrals marketplace*

***Purpose of this document:** Outline a brief intro deck (aim \= 10 minutes read-through) with a vague idea of what this is and precursor to full pitch deck*

***Audience:** Angels and pre-seed VCs*

1) **Front page**  
   * Mamori \- your trusted marketplace for your health needs  
   * What it is \+ who it’s for

2) **Purpose & Vision**  
   * Purpose: Ensure no one has to figure out their health alone.  
   * Vision: Be the neutral destination where health claims meet evidence and consumers meet vetted options, so people can act earlier and live longer, healthier lives.

3) **The Problem; Decision Debt in Consumer Health**  
   * People are losing healthy life years because acting preventively is hard: information is noisy, health literacy is limited, and access is inconvenient.  
   * Claims from influencers, brands, and time‑pressed clinicians collide; most people default to inaction or poor choices.  
   * Fragmented point solutions answer slices of a bigger question; individuals need end‑to‑end guidance from concern → clarified need → right test/product → interpretation → action.  
   * Equity gap: those with lower literacy/income bear higher risk and receive the least personalized support.’  
   * Maybe statistic on “wasted” money if we can find  
   * \[maybe we have some big stat numbers here\] 

4) **The problem: Human Stories (persona-led maybe?)**  
   * Testimonials, e.g.  
     * “Am I at risk for heart disease and what can I do now?”  
     * “Which magnesium actually helps with sleep—and is it safe with my meds?”  
     * “GLP‑1s: should I consider them, and how do i get them?”  
     * “I am concerned about prostate cancer but don’t feel like going to my doctor unless its an emergency”  
     * “Skin health & aesthetics: which actives or clinics are trustworthy for my goals?”

5) **The solution: The Neutral Health Marketplace**  
   * A consumer‑first marketplace that standardizes listings, explains evidence in plain language, and routes to vetted merchants/clinics.  
   * Launch as buyer’s guide \+ referrals; enable selective on‑site checkout once trust & unit economics are proven.  
   * No house brands. No pay‑to‑rank. Visible disclosures separating evidence, fit, and commercial terms.  
   * \[nice screenshots of mobile and desktop views of UI\]

6) **The solution: 1-2 slides on the business**  
   * Make sure we are selling the business and not just listing cool features  
   * Product in one picture (Demo storyboard): A single flow: “claim → evidence summary → vetted options → action.”  
   * gif with AI chat on better sleep  
   * Categories  
   * Proprietary evidence engine  
   * Topic hubs  
   * Access and routing   
   * Community design  
   * Maybe some testimonials from early testers?   
       
7) **Why Now (might skip?)**  
   * Consumerization of diagnostics and monitoring (home tests, wearables) has normalized learning and acting between visits.  
   * AI is finally useful for evidence triage and labeling—if governed with a human‑in‑the‑loop approach.  
   * Consumers distrust ad‑ranked marketplaces; transparency is a differentiator.  
   * We need to make sure it explains why people are willing to pay for this  
       
8) **Market size and growth projections**  
   * RESEARCH NEEDED: TAM/SAM/SOM for EU consumer digital health; adoption rates for home testing & wearables; growth forecasts.  
   * Ideally we show that the market will grow explosively over the next 10 years so we are riding the curve

9) **Competition and market gap**  
   * Evidence Explainers (depth, neutral) — gap: no personal fit or access.  
   * Independent Testing (trust signal) — gap: limited breadth; no end‑to‑end journey.  
   * Retail Marketplaces (breadth, logistics) — gap: pay‑to‑rank, low medical nuance.  
   * Telehealth/Programs (closed‑loop) — gap: vendor incentives to sell own solution.  
   * Our edge: neutral decision layer that unifies evidence clarity, standardized listings, personal fit, and trusted access.  
   * \[RESEARCH NEEDED: fill in named examples per category in EU/US; build comparison table.\]  
   * Maybe do as comparison table

10) **Founders journey**  
    * Paul and my journey up until this point in a vertical timeline converging in the end \+ why are we the perfect founders to tackle this challenge

11) **Business Model \+ GTM**  
    * Phase 0–1 (0–9 months): Build Audience \+ trust. Free access to explainers; curated 100–200 listings; test affiliate/referral revenue with full disclosures. \[identify and secure launch partners\]  
    * Phase 2: Evidence+ Membership (€5–€9/month) — advanced filters, evidence alerts, saved stacks with interaction checks, member Q\&As.  
    * Phase 3: B2B & embedded commerce — white‑label evidence modules; curated storefronts where legal; anonymized aggregate data products (strict privacy).  
    * \[mention locations, i.e. launch in Denmark then grow through Europe into ME and US etc? \- currencies and languages\]

12) **Financial projection (might take out?)**  
    * User, Revenue and EBITDA projections

13) **Traction & Current Status**  
    * Status: marketplace concept \+ design system; evidence engine specs defined; partner outreach in progress.  
    * Near‑term milestones (next 90 days): 100–200 live listings; 10 priority topic hubs; 5 launch merchant partners; Founders Club alpha.  
    * \[PLACEHOLDER: Live metrics, signups, waitlist size, early partner MOUs.\]  
    * Can we demonstrate that we have captured some share of a target audience?

14) **The Ask; Funding, Use of Proceeds, Milestones**  
    * £100k–£300k pre‑seed  
    * Use of funds: 40% product & data (evidence engine MVP), 30% content/editorial, 20% partnerships & compliance, 10% community operations.  
    * 6 month milestones: 10k users, 10 priority hubs live, 200 listings, ≥5 merchant partnerships, first € revenue, Trust Manifesto published.  
    * Aiming at new round in 6 months (3-5 KPIs that gate Seed)

* Regulatory and compliance posture  
* Product roadmap (now / next / later)  
* Risks and mitigation

**NOTES**

1. We are training our own AI on this data; facts, stats, consumer feedback, reviews \= valuable.   
2. Ecommerce trends \= AI powered search is becoming common, people are used to standard layouts and navigational paradigms.  
3. Natural language search \= rather than clicking through filters user just writes “whats best magnesium to help me sleep” and they get a list of products matching this search  
4.
