- **Position:** 1.62 (near top of page 1)

- "product strategy consulting" - 93 impressions, position 57.69

| Real Estate Lead Gen Guide | 1 | 477 | 0.21% | 8.26 |

- "fractional cpo" - 33 impressions, position 69.67 (page 7!)
- "fractional product managers" - 23 impressions, position 90.57 (page 9!)

**Problem:** Product strategy pages aren't optimized or have low authority.

**3. No Indexed Programmatic SEO Pages Yet**
- 0 industry pages in top pages
- 0 location pages in top pages  
- 0 comparison pages in top pages
- 0 solution pages in top pages

**Problem:** We just deployed 59 new pages today (Nov 1) - they aren't in this data set yet.
