      {
        "question": "What determines if I need the $15K vs $35K vs $75K solution?",
        "answer": "Three factors: (1) Number of integrations - each adds $2K-5K, (2) Compliance requirements - HIPAA/PCI adds $10K-15K, (3) Complexity - simple booking vs multi-step workflows. We can estimate in 30-min consultation."

        "question": "Are monthly costs really that low ($300-600)?",

      {
        "question": "How do you compare to other agencies/platforms?",

      {
        "question": "What if we hire agency then want to take over later?",
        "answer": "Perfect approach. We hand off clean code, documentation, and train your team. Many clients do: agency for MVP (prove value fast), hire engineer after validation to expand features. We support this."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we do a hybrid (agency builds, we maintain)?",
        "answer": "Yes! Common model: We build (3-8 weeks), hand off code, your engineers handle minor updates. We stay available for major features/fixes. Saves you maintenance cost ($300-1K/month) if you have technical team."

      {
        "question": "How do I know if my use case is too simple for custom build?",
        "answer": "If your workflow is: (1) Single integration, (2) No compliance requirements, (3) Template conversation flow, (4) < 500 interactions/month → Try SaaS first. Everything else benefits from custom."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the 'opportunity cost' you mention?",
        "answer": "If your engineers spend 6 months building AI instead of core product, what revenue did you miss? If core product generates $50K/month and AI delays launch 6 months, opportunity cost is $300K. Factor this into 'build' decision."
      },
      {
        "question": "What would YOU recommend for most companies?",
        "answer": "Honest answer: Agency for first AI project (prove value fast, low risk). If it works and you want more AI features, hire in-house team or keep using agency for speed. Don't hire AI engineer before proving the use case works."
