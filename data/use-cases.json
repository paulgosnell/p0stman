        "question": "What if customer disputes the charge?",
        "answer": "AI is trained to detect dispute language ('I don't owe this', 'this is wrong'). Immediately pauses collection, logs dispute, and escalates to human. No further collection contact until dispute resolved."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can it handle negotiated settlements?",
        "answer": "Within pre-approved parameters, yes. E.g., 'Settle for 80% if paid today.' For larger settlements or outside policy, AI escalates to human negotiator with customer's offer and payment history."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does PCI compliance work?",
        "answer": "AI never handles raw credit card numbers. Uses secure payment forms (Stripe Elements or similar). Customer enters card directly into PCI-compliant iframe. Only tokenized reference stored in your system."

        "question": "What's the collection rate compared to humans?",
        "answer": "For first 60 days past due, AI matches or beats human collection rates (30-40% recovery). After 90 days, human negotiators perform better. Best practice: AI handles 0-60 days past due, humans handle 60+ days."
