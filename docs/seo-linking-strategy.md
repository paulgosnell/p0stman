# SEO Linking Strategy for P0STMAN

> **Purpose:** Optimize internal linking and sitemaps for maximum SEO impact and LLM discoverability
> **Last Updated:** October 12, 2025
> **Status:** Active

---

## üéØ Overview

Your linking strategy has 3 primary goals:
1. **Search Engine Crawlability** - Help Google/Bing discover and index all pages
2. **Internal PageRank Flow** - Distribute link authority to important pages
3. **LLM Training** - Ensure content is crawlable for ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity training

---

## üîó Internal Linking Strategy

### 1. Footer Links (Implemented ‚úÖ)

**What We Did:**
- Added "Resources" section to footer
- Includes link to AI Cost Guide article
- Added /guides and /blog hub pages

**Why Footer Links Matter:**
- ‚úÖ **Global placement** - Every page on site links to articles
- ‚úÖ **Crawl priority** - Google sees these as important (footer = sitewide)
- ‚úÖ **User access** - Easy discovery from any page
- ‚úÖ **Internal PageRank** - Passes link equity to article pages

**Best Practices:**
- Keep to 3-5 featured articles max (don't spam footer)
- Update quarterly with top-performing content
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "Click here")
- Prioritize commercial-intent articles (like cost guides)

**Current Footer Structure:**
```
Services | Work | How We Work | Why We Do It | Resources
                                               ‚îú‚îÄ AI Development Costs (article)
                                               ‚îú‚îÄ Guides (hub)
                                               ‚îî‚îÄ Blog (hub)
```

---

### 2. Contextual In-Content Links (High Priority)

**Where to Add:**
- Service pages (/ai-agents, /website, /mobile-app)
- Case studies
- Homepage
- About/Process pages

**Example Placements:**

**On /ai-agents page:**
> "Wondering how much an AI agent costs? Check our [complete cost & timeline guide](/guides/ai-agent-development-cost-timeline-guide-2025)."

**On homepage (service section):**
> "From $5k pilots to production systems - see our [transparent pricing breakdown](/guides/ai-agent-development-cost-timeline-guide-2025)."

**On /case-studies page:**
> "All projects delivered 40% faster than agencies. Learn more in our [AI development guide](/guides/ai-agent-development-cost-timeline-guide-2025)."

**Best Practices:**
- 3-5 internal links per page
- Contextual (not forced)
- Descriptive anchor text
- Link to related content
- Mix of commercial + informational links

---

### 3. Hub Pages (Create These)

**Why Hub Pages?**
- Central index for all articles
- Better UX than dumping users on a single article
- Distributes PageRank to individual articles
- Easy to update with new content

**Create Two Hubs:**

#### A. `/guides` - SEO Guides Hub

**Purpose:** Commercial-intent, high-value guides
**Structure:**
```
/guides/
  ‚îú‚îÄ ai-agent-development-cost-timeline-guide-2025
  ‚îú‚îÄ voice-ai-platforms-comparison-2025
  ‚îú‚îÄ chatgpt-vs-custom-ai-agent-guide
  ‚îî‚îÄ ... (future articles from content-strategy.md)
```

**Hub Page Content:**
- Hero: "Expert Guides for Building AI Products"
- Grid of guide cards (image, title, excerpt, CTA)
- Filter by topic (cost, technical, comparison)
- Latest first, then featured
- Footer CTA to contact

#### B. `/blog` - Thought Leadership

**Purpose:** Informational, educational, industry commentary
**Structure:**
```
/blog/
  ‚îú‚îÄ future-of-ai-agents-2025
  ‚îú‚îÄ why-consultants-dont-ship
  ‚îú‚îÄ multi-model-ai-systems
  ‚îî‚îÄ ... (lighter content)
```

**Difference from Guides:**
- Guides = "How to X" / "Cost of Y" / "X vs Y"
- Blog = "Why X matters" / "The future of Y" / "My take on Z"

---

### 4. Header/Navigation Links (Conditional)

**Current Approach:**
- Don't add "Blog" to main nav yet (too early, low content volume)
- Wait until 5+ articles published
- Then add dropdown: "Resources ‚Üí Guides | Blog"

**When to Add:**
- ‚úÖ After 5+ articles published
- ‚úÖ When organic traffic shows promise
- ‚úÖ After validating content performs

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Adding nav link to empty/thin blog section
- ‚ùå Cluttering nav before proving content value

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Sitemap Strategy

### Current Sitemap (Updated ‚úÖ)

**What We Did:**
- Added `/guides/ai-agent-development-cost-timeline-guide-2025`
- Priority: 0.9 (high commercial value)
- Changefreq: monthly
- Lastmod: 2025-10-12

**Sitemap Best Practices:**

#### Priority Values (0.0 - 1.0)
- **1.0:** Homepage only
- **0.9:** High-value commercial pages (guides, service pages, top case studies)
- **0.8:** Important content (other articles, case studies)
- **0.7:** Secondary pages (about, process)
- **0.5:** Tertiary pages (archive, tag pages)

#### Change Frequency
- **daily:** Homepage (if frequently updated)
- **weekly:** Blog/news content
- **monthly:** Guides, service pages (our current approach ‚úÖ)
- **yearly:** Static pages (about, contact)

#### Last Modified Date
- **Must be accurate** - Google uses this to determine crawl priority
- Update when content changes materially
- Use ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD

---

### Auto-Generating Sitemap (Future Enhancement)

When you have 20+ articles, manual sitemap updates become tedious. Options:

**Option 1: Build Script**
```bash
# Generate sitemap from /docs/articles/*.md
npm run generate-sitemap
```

**Option 2: Dynamic Sitemap Route**
```typescript
// src/routes/sitemap.xml.ts
// Dynamically generates XML from article metadata
```

**Option 3: CMS Integration**
- If you move to Sanity/Contentful later
- Auto-publish updates sitemap

**Current Recommendation:**
- Manual updates fine for now (<20 articles)
- Revisit after Article 15

---

## üìä Sitemap Submission

### Google Search Console

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)

---

### robots.txt

‚ùå **Link spam**
- Don't add 20 links to every article
- 3-5 contextual links per page max

‚ùå **Irrelevant links**

‚ùå **Broken links**
- Check links after route changes
- Run crawl audit quarterly

‚ùå **All links to one page**

- Not everything links to homepage

‚ùå **Orphan pages**

  2. Related content (service page, case study, etc.)

‚ùå **Footer link overload**
- Keep footer focused (3-5 featured articles)

**Option 3: MDX (Markdown + React)**

**Recommendation for Now:**
- Start with Option 1 (static HTML)
