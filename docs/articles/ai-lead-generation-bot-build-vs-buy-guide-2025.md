## Build vs Buy: Decision Framework

### Buy Off-the-Shelf If:

✅ **Simple use case** (email capture, basic qualification)
✅ **Budget under $5k**
✅ **Need live today** (no time for custom build)
✅ **Standard qualification questions** (not industry-specific)
✅ **Low volume** (<1,000 leads/month)
✅ **No deep CRM customization** needed
✅ **Text chat is sufficient** (no voice)

**Platforms to Consider:**
- Drift (chat-based)
- Qualified (built for sales teams)
- Intercom (support + sales)
- HubSpot Chat (if using HubSpot CRM)

---

### Build Custom If:

✅ **Complex qualification logic** (industry-specific, multi-step)
✅ **Budget $5k+** (realistic for custom)
✅ **Voice conversations** needed (outbound or inbound)
✅ **Deep CRM integration** (Salesforce, HubSpot, custom CRM)
✅ **High volume** (1,000+ leads/month, cost optimization matters)
✅ **Unique workflows** (not supported by platforms)
✅ **Brand control** (white-label, no "Powered by X")
✅ **Competitive advantage** (your lead gen process is your edge)

**What You Can Build:**
- Voice agents (ElevenLabs, LiveKit)
- AI chat agents (custom logic)
- Hybrid (chat → voice handoff)
- Multi-channel (web, SMS, phone)

---

## Cost Comparison: Real Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Startup (Early Stage)

**Scenario:**
- 200 website visitors/day
- Want to capture leads, qualify for demo
- Simple qualification (company size, role, budget)

**Option A: Drift ($1,200/month)**
- Setup: Same day (no-code)
- Qualification flows: Pre-built
- CRM integration: HubSpot (native)
- **Total Year 1:** ~$14,500

**Option B: Custom AI Chat ($25k production)**
- Setup: 6 days pilot ($6k) + 3 weeks production ($25k)
- Qualification: Custom logic, AI-powered
- CRM integration: Full HubSpot sync
- **Total Year 1:** ~$31k ($25k build + $6k APIs/hosting)

**Winner:** Drift (at this stage)
**Why:** Volume doesn't justify custom, standard qualification works

---

### Example 2: Real Estate Brokerage

**Scenario:**
- 500 leads/month
- Want voice calls to qualify (not just chat)
- Ask 7 questions: budget, timeline, location, financing, etc.
- Route hot leads to agents immediately

**Option A: No Direct Equivalent**
- Drift can't do voice
- Would need Drift + call center (expensive)

**Option B: Custom Voice Agent ($32k)**
- Setup: 6 days pilot ($7k) + 3 weeks production ($32k)
- Voice: ElevenLabs Conversational AI
- Qualification: Custom 7-question flow
- CRM: Salesforce integration
- Routing: Hot leads → agent Slack notification
- **Total Year 1:** ~$42k ($32k build + $10k platform costs)
- **Outcome:** 65% of leads qualified by AI, 35% to human agents

**Winner:** Custom voice agent (only option)
**Why:** Voice requirement, Drift/platforms don't support this

**ROI:**
- Replaced 2 FTE phone reps ($80k/year)
- Payback in 6 months
- 24/7 availability (was 9-5)

---

### Example 3: B2B Enterprise Software

**Scenario:**
- High-ticket product ($100k+ ACV)
- Complex qualification (20+ criteria)
- Multi-touch (chat → email → call)
- Deep Salesforce integration

**Option A: Qualified ($2,400/month)**
- Setup: 2-3 days
- Qualification: Custom rules (their builder)
- Salesforce: Native integration
- **Total Year 1:** ~$29k

**Option B: Custom AI Chat + Voice ($45k)**
- Setup: 8 days pilot ($8k) + 4 weeks production ($45k)
- AI chat: Natural conversation, complex logic
- Voice: Option to escalate to voice call
- Salesforce: Full bi-directional sync
- Analytics: Custom dashboard
- **Total Year 1:** ~$53k ($45k build + $8k ops)

**Winner:** Depends on volume and complexity
- **Under 500 leads/month:** Qualified likely sufficient
- **Over 2,000 leads/month:** Custom pays for itself (better qualification = higher conversion = more revenue)

**Decision Point:** Model revenue impact
- If custom increases qualification accuracy by 10% → 200 extra qualified leads/year
- If close rate is 20% → 40 extra deals
- At $100k ACV → $4M extra revenue
- **ROI:** 75x on $53k investment

## Custom Build: What You Can Do

### Voice Agent (Outbound)

**Use Case:** Call leads to qualify, book meetings

**How It Works:**
1. Lead comes in (web form, ad, purchased list)
2. AI voice agent calls within 5 minutes
3. Asks qualification questions (7-10 questions)
4. Handles objections, books meeting if qualified
5. Logs to CRM, notifies sales rep

**Tech Stack:**
- ElevenLabs Conversational AI (or LiveKit)

- OpenAI/Claude (AI reasoning)
- CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)

**Cost:**
- Pilot: $7k (6-8 days)
- Production: $30k-35k (3-4 weeks)

- 24/7 availability
- 60-80% leads qualified without human
- Faster response time (5 min vs 2+ hours)

---

### Voice Agent (Inbound)

**Use Case:** Answer incoming calls, qualify, route

**How It Works:**

- Reduced phone staff (3 FTE → 1 FTE)
- Higher answer rate (100% vs 70%)

---

### AI Chat Agent (Website)

**Use Case:** Website chat, intelligent qualification

**How It Works:**
1. Visitor lands on site
2. Chatbot engages (context-aware)

**ROI:**
- Best of both worlds (chat efficiency + voice personal touch)
- Higher conversion on escalated leads

---

## ROI Calculation Framework

### Formula

**Annual Value of Lead Gen Bot = (Leads Qualified × Close Rate × ACV) - Total Cost**

**Example: B2B SaaS**

**Inputs:**
- Leads/month: 500
- Qualified by bot: 70% (350/month)
- Human would qualify: 40% (200/month)
- **Extra qualified leads:** 150/month = 1,800/year
- Close rate: 15%
- Deals from bot: 270/year
- ACV: $25k
- **Revenue from bot:** $6.75M/year

**Costs:**
- Custom voice agent: $35k (year 1)
- Ongoing: $15k/year (APIs, hosting, maintenance)
- **Total Cost (Year 1):** $50k

**ROI: $6.7M / $50k = 134x**

Even if numbers are 1/10th of this, ROI is 13x—still excellent.

---

### Variables That Impact ROI

**1. Lead Volume**
- More leads = better ROI (fixed cost amortized)
- Under 100/month: Platform probably fine
- Over 1,000/month: Custom justifies itself

**2. ACV (Average Contract Value)**
- Higher ACV = higher ROI per qualified lead
- Under $5k ACV: Platforms may suffice
- Over $50k ACV: Custom qualification pays dividends

**3. Close Rate Improvement**
- If bot qualifies better → higher close rate → more revenue
- Even 5% improvement = massive impact

**4. Speed to Lead**
- Calling in 5 min vs 2 hours = 9x higher contact rate (industry data)
- AI voice agents call instantly

---

## Implementation Timelines

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Buying Platform When Custom Needed

**Problem:** "We'll use Drift because it's fast"
**Reality:** Drift can't do voice, can't handle complex logic, costs $30k/year
**Outcome:** 6 months later, rebuilding custom ($35k) + wasted $15k on Drift

**Solution:** Assess requirements first—if voice or complex logic needed, go custom from start

---

### Mistake 2: Building Custom When Platform Sufficient

**Problem:** "We need custom because it's better"
**Reality:** $35k custom build for simple email capture (Drift does this for $500/month)
**Outcome:** Over-engineered, 10x more expensive than needed

**Solution:** Start simple, upgrade if needed

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Voice

**Problem:** "Chat is fine for lead gen"
**Reality:** Voice converts 3-5x better for high-value B2B leads
**Outcome:** Leaving money on the table

**Solution:** Model ROI—if high ACV, voice may justify the investment

---

### Mistake 4: No CRM Integration

**Problem:** Lead gen bot captures leads but doesn't sync to CRM
**Reality:** Sales team doesn't see leads, or manual entry required
**Outcome:** Leads lost, sales team frustrated

**Solution:** CRM integration is non-negotiable (custom or platform)

---

## When to Choose Voice vs Chat

### Choose Voice If:

✅ High ACV (>$25k)
✅ Personal touch matters
✅ Complex sale (B2B, multiple stakeholders)
✅ Older demographic (prefer phone)
✅ Outbound required (calling leads)
✅ Real-time objection handling critical

**Example Use Cases:**
- Real estate (high-value, personal)
- B2B enterprise software
- Financial services
- Professional services (legal, consulting)

---

### Choose Chat If:

✅ Lower ACV (<$10k)
✅ Younger demographic (prefer text)
✅ Simple qualification
✅ Inbound only (website visitors)
✅ Budget-conscious
✅ Global audience (timezones, voice harder)

**Example Use Cases:**
- SaaS (self-serve)
- E-commerce
- Lead magnets (ebook, webinar)
- Simple appointment booking

---

### Hybrid Approach

**Best of both:**
- Start with chat (lower friction)
- Escalate to voice if high-value or complex
- **Example:** Chat qualifies, voice books meeting

---

---

## FAQ

### Can I start with a platform and move to custom later?

**Yes, but:**
- Expect rebuild ($20k-35k)
- Conversation data may not be portable
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks

**Better:** Pilot with custom ($7k, 6 days), commit if validated

---

### How long until ROI positive?

**Typical:**
- Voice agents: 3-6 months (replacing FTEs)
- Chat agents: 6-12 months (incremental revenue)
- Depends on volume and ACV

**High ACV (>$50k):** ROI can be 1-2 deals (weeks to months)

---

### What's the best platform for small business?

**Under $5k/year budget:**
- HubSpot Chat (if using HubSpot)
- Intercom (good all-rounder)

**Under $15k/year budget:**
- Drift (if B2B SaaS)
- Qualified (if enterprise, Salesforce)

---

### Do voice agents sound robotic?

**2025 Answer:** No, if using ElevenLabs or good TTS
- ElevenLabs voices are near-human
- Conversations feel natural
- Leads rarely realize it's AI (until told)

---

### Can AI handle objections?

**Yes, with training:**
- Script common objections
- AI improvises within guardrails
- Escalates to human if stuck

**Success rate:** 70-80% of objections handled by AI

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Assess Your Needs
