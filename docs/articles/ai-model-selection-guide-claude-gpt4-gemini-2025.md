---

### How to Implement Multi-Model

**Step 1: Classify Task Complexity**

*User Query:* "What's your return policy?"
*Classification:* Simple → Route to Gemini Flash

*User Query:* "I have a complex situation with a damaged item that was a gift..."
*Classification:* Complex → Route to GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet

**Step 2: Route to Appropriate Model**

```
Classifier (lightweight model) → Determines complexity → Routes to:
  - Gemini Flash (30%): Simple FAQs, lookups
  - GPT-4o (60%): General queries, customer-facing
  - Claude Sonnet (10%): Complex logic, nuanced decisions
```

**Step 3: Monitor & Adjust**

- Track performance by model
- Adjust routing rules
- Optimize for cost + quality

---

### Real Example: SaaS Support Chatbot

**Scenario:** 10,000 conversations/month

**Single-Model (GPT-4o only):**
- Cost: $300/month
- Quality: Good
- Resolution Rate: 75%

**Multi-Model Strategy:**
- **Gemini Flash (40% of queries):** "How do I reset password?" "What's your pricing?" etc.
  - Cost: $40/month
  - Quality: Good (for simple tasks)

- **GPT-4o (50% of queries):** General questions, moderate complexity
  - Cost: $150/month
  - Quality: Good

- **Claude Sonnet (10% of queries):** "Why is my integration failing?" "Complex account issue..."
  - Cost: $50/month
  - Quality: Excellent (for complex tasks)

**Total Cost:** $240/month (20% savings)
**Resolution Rate:** 82% (7% improvement, using Claude for complex cases)

---

## Cost Optimization Tactics

### Tactic 1: Shorter Prompts

**Problem:** Verbose prompts increase cost
**Solution:** Optimize system prompts, remove fluff

**Example:**
- **Before:** 500-word system prompt → $0.015/conversation
- **After:** 150-word system prompt → $0.005/conversation
- **Savings:** 67%

---

### Tactic 2: Response Length Limits

**Problem:** Models generate long-winded responses
**Solution:** Set max_tokens limits

**Example:**
- **Before:** Average 800 tokens/response → $0.024/conversation
- **After:** Max 300 tokens (still sufficient) → $0.009/conversation
- **Savings:** 62%

---

### Tactic 3: Caching (Claude-Specific)

**Feature:** Claude supports prompt caching (repeat queries cheaper)

**Example:**
- First query: $0.015
- Cached query (same context): $0.003
- **Savings:** 80% on repeated queries

**Use case:** Chatbots with static knowledge base (same context every query)

---

### Tactic 4: Downgrade Model When Possible

**Strategy:** Use cheaper model until it fails, escalate to expensive model

**Example:**
- Try Gemini Flash first (cheapest)
- If confidence < 80%, escalate to GPT-4o
- If still < 90%, escalate to Claude Sonnet

**Result:** 70% of queries handled by Gemini (cheap), 30% by more expensive models (when needed)

---

## Future-Proofing Your AI Architecture

### Design for Model Agnostic

**Problem:** Building around one model = vendor lock-in

**Solution:** Abstraction layer

**Example:**
```
Your App → AI Abstraction Layer → { Claude, GPT-4, Gemini }
```

**Benefits:**
- Swap models without rewriting code
- A/B test models (which performs better?)
- Fallback redundancy (if Claude down, use GPT-4)

---

### Monitor Model Performance

**What to track:**
- Cost per conversation (by model)
- Resolution rate (by model)
- Customer satisfaction (by model)
- Latency (by model)

**Why:** Models improve/change over time, re-evaluate quarterly

---

### Stay Model-Current (But Not Bleeding Edge)

**Strategy:**
- Use production-stable models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Test new models (e.g., GPT-5 when released) in pilot
- Upgrade when new model is 20%+ better or 20%+ cheaper

**Avoid:** Chasing every new model release (stability matters)

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based on Hype

**Problem:** "GPT-4 is best, we'll use it for everything"
**Reality:** Claude better for complex reasoning, Gemini cheaper for volume
**Solution:** Match model to use case (this guide!)

---

### Mistake 2: Not Considering Cost at Scale

**Problem:** "GPT-4 costs $0.10/conversation, that's nothing!"
**Reality:** At 100k conversations/month = $10k/month
**Solution:** Model total cost at projected scale, optimize from start

---

### Mistake 3: Using Expensive Model for Everything

**Problem:** Using Claude Opus for "What's your phone number?" (overkill)
**Reality:** Gemini Flash can handle this for 1/100th the cost
**Solution:** Multi-model strategy, route by complexity

---

### Mistake 4: Not Testing Multiple Models

**Problem:** Assume one model is best
**Reality:** Performance varies by use case
**Solution:** A/B test (10% traffic to each model, measure performance)

---

## FAQ

### Which model is "best"?

**There's no single best model.** Depends on use case:
- **Speed + volume:** Gemini Flash
- **General use:** GPT-4o
