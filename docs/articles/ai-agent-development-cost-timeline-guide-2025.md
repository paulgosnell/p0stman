---

## Timeline Reality Check

### Why 6 Days for MVP?

At P0STMAN, we ship MVPs in 6 days on average—40% faster than traditional agencies. Here's how:

**Traditional Agency Timeline (10 days):**
- Day 1-2: Discovery calls, stakeholder alignment, proposal refinement
- Day 3-4: Design mockups, review cycles
- Day 5-8: Development
- Day 9-10: QA, revisions, delivery

**AI-Powered Timeline (6 days):**
- Day 1: AI-assisted research + planning (done in hours, not days)
- Day 2: Context engineering + architecture setup
- Day 3-5: AI-first development (Claude Code, Cursor)
- Day 6: Human validation, testing, delivery

**The unlock:** AI handles boilerplate, docs, and repetitive work. Human focuses on architecture, validation, commercial viability.

### Why 3 Weeks Minimum for Production?

Production isn't just "more features"—it's:
- Security hardening
- Error handling for edge cases
- Monitoring and alerting
- Load testing
- Documentation
- Analytics setup
- Deployment automation

Rushing this creates technical debt. 3 weeks is the floor, not the ceiling.

### Red Flags to Watch

**"We can do it in 2 days":**
- Probably a template with your logo slapped on
- Zero customization
- Not production-ready

**"It'll take 6 months":**
- Corporate overhead, not complexity
- Or genuinely complex (enterprise-scale systems)
- Ask for phased delivery milestones

## Build vs Buy Decision Framework

### When to Use ChatGPT Plugin/Assistant (Don't Build Custom)

✅ Simple Q&A with static knowledge base
✅ Budget under $5k
✅ No custom integrations needed
✅ Standard use case (support, FAQs)
✅ Can work within OpenAI's limitations

**Cost:** $500-2k for setup
**Timeline:** 1-3 days
**Limitation:** Locked into OpenAI ecosystem, limited customization

### When to Build Custom AI Agent

✅ Need multi-model approach (Claude + GPT + Gemini)
✅ Complex workflows or multi-step processes
✅ Custom integrations (CRM, proprietary systems)
✅ Brand control (not "Powered by ChatGPT")
✅ Data privacy requirements (self-hosted)
✅ Advanced analytics and reporting
✅ Commercial product (not internal tool)

**Cost:** $5k-50k+
**Timeline:** 6 days to 6 weeks
**Benefit:** Complete control, scalability, differentiation

### The Hybrid Approach

Some clients start with ChatGPT Assistant for proof of concept ($1k, 2 days), then move to custom build once validated ($25k, 3 weeks).

**This works if:**
- You're uncertain about demand
- Budget is phased
- You can migrate without full rebuild

**This doesn't work if:**
- You need custom integrations from day one
- ChatGPT limitations block your core use case

## How to Evaluate Quotes

Got quotes from multiple developers/agencies? Here's what to compare:

### 1. What's Actually Included?

❌ "AI agent development: $15k"
✅ "Voice agent with ElevenLabs, CRM integration, analytics dashboard, production deployment: $28k"

Ask for itemized breakdown.

### 2. Timeline Realism

❌ "Production-ready in 3 days"
✅ "MVP in 6 days, production-ready in 3 weeks"

Fast is good. Too fast is red flag.

### 3. Post-Launch Support

❌ Delivery = end of engagement
✅ 30-day support, then monthly retainer option

Agents need tuning after launch. Factor this in.

### 4. Technology Stack

Ask:
- Which AI models? (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini?)
- Which platforms? (ElevenLabs, LiveKit, custom?)
- Multi-model or single model?
- Infrastructure (serverless, managed, self-hosted?)

### 5. Track Record

❌ "We've built 50 AI projects" (undefined)
✅ "Here are 3 production AI agents we've shipped with measurable results"

Demand specifics. Not POCs. Not demos. Production code.

## Common Mistakes That Inflate Costs

### 1. Unclear Scope

**Problem:** "We want an AI agent for customer service"
**Better:** "AI chat agent that answers 20 common questions, integrates with Zendesk, escalates to human after 3 failed attempts"

Vague scope = scope creep = cost overruns.

### 2. Over-Engineering the Pilot

**Problem:** "Let's build the full production system from day one"
**Better:** "Let's validate core functionality with a $6k pilot, then invest in production"

Pilots prove concepts. Production scales them. Don't mix them.

### 3. Ignoring Post-Launch Costs

AI agents aren't "set it and forget it." Budget for:
- API costs
- Monitoring
- Tuning and optimization
- Model updates

### 4. Wrong Model Choice

**Problem:** Using GPT-4 for everything (expensive, overkill)
**Better:** GPT-4 for complex reasoning, GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, Claude for long context

Multi-model approach saves money and improves results.

### 5. Not Challenging the Brief

**Problem:** Building exactly what you asked for (even if it's wrong)
**Better:** Working with someone who challenges your assumptions and improves the idea

20+ years of experience means we've seen this before. We'll tell you if your plan won't work.
