## Common Mistakes When Choosing

### Mistake 1: Over-Engineering from Day One

**Problem:** "We might need X someday, so let's build custom now"
**Reality:** 70% of features you think you'll need, you won't
**Solution:** Start simple (ElevenLabs), migrate if validated

---

### Mistake 2: Under-Estimating Complexity

**Problem:** "It's just a simple conversation, ElevenLabs will work"
**Reality:** "Simple" conversation has 15 edge cases and complex routing
**Solution:** Map full conversation tree before choosing platform

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Total Cost

**Problem:** Focus only on development cost
**Reality:** Platform costs can dwarf development costs
**Solution:** Model total 12-month cost (dev + platform + ops)

---

### Mistake 4: Wrong Platform for Use Case

**Problem:** Using ElevenLabs for multi-party sales coaching
**Reality:** Platform literally can't do it
**Solution:** Match platform capabilities to requirements (this guide!)

---
