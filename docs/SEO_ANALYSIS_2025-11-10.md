## 🚨 Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Low CTR Despite Good Positions

**Pages with Position 6-10 but Low CTR:**

| Page | Position | CTR | Problem |
|------|----------|-----|---------|
| Security Guide | 6.96 | 0.08% | Title not compelling |
| Model Selection | 6.12 | 0.17% | Wrong query intent |
| Dev Cost Guide | 6.95 | 0.15% | Not standing out |

**Average CTR for position 6-7 should be 3-5%**
**Your pages at position 6-7 are getting 0.08-0.17%**
**This is 20-60x WORSE than expected**

**Root Cause:**
1. Title tags not compelling enough
2. Meta descriptions not actionable
3. OR ranking for wrong queries (informational vs commercial)

**Action:**
1. Check GSC for actual queries per page
2. Rewrite titles to be more compelling
3. Add power words ("Free", "Complete", "2025 Guide")
4. Ensure meta descriptions have clear value prop

---

### Issue #2: Programmatic Pages Missing/Not Indexed

**Expected (from GSC_INSIGHTS.md):**
- 59 programmatic pages deployed Nov 1
- 30 industry pages
- 8 location pages
- 9 comparison pages
- 8 solution pages

**Reality (from Nov 10 data):**
- 0 industry pages showing
- 0 location pages showing
- 0 comparison pages showing (other than 1 guide)
- 0 solution pages showing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Not actually deployed
2. Deployed but not in sitemap
3. In sitemap but not crawled yet (only 9 days since Nov 1)
4. Crawled but not indexed (thin content, duplicate content, etc.)

**Action:**
1. Verify pages actually exist and are live
2. Check sitemap.xml includes all pages
3. Check GSC coverage report for errors
4. Submit sitemap if not done
5. Check robots.txt not blocking pages

---

### Issue #3: US Market CTR Collapse

**US Performance:**
- 79% of all impressions
- Only 15% of all clicks
- CTR: 0.07% (5x worse than site average)

**Rest of World:**
- 21% of impressions
- 85% of clicks
- CTR: 1.5% average (42x better!)

**Analysis:**
- US competition is fierce (you're showing but not standing out)
- OR US queries are informational (research, not buying intent)
- International queries are more specific/commercial

**Action:**
1. Check US-specific queries in GSC
2. May need US-specific content (pricing in USD, US case studies, etc.)
3. Consider paid ads for US market to supplement organic
