## 🧪 Testing

Build successful:
```bash
npm run build
✓ built in 10.99s
```

No TypeScript errors, all components compile correctly.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track overlay open rate
   - Conversation completion rate
   - User engagement metrics

2. **A/B Testing**
   - Test different trigger delays
   - Test different CTA copy
   - Test orb size/colors

3. **Sound Effects**
   - Subtle "whoosh" on open

   - Notification sound for AI response

4. **Persistence**
   - Remember if user dismissed
   - Don't show again if recently interacted
   - localStorage to track user preference

5. **WebGL Upgrade**
   - Three.js for even smoother orb
   - 3D rotation effects
   - More complex particle systems
