    resources.\
-   **Risk:** Lack of regional coordination weakens global
    competitiveness.

### 7. Cybersecurity and National Security Threats

AI-enabled systems increase vulnerability to hacking, data poisoning,
and adversarial attacks. Critical infrastructure such as oil refineries,
ports, and airports are prime targets.

-   **Example:** Regional banks report a rise in AI-driven fraud
    attempts.\
-   **Risk:** Large-scale cyberattacks could undermine trust in AI
    systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What's Next

-   Aggressive investment in **AI education and reskilling**, with
    regional collaboration.\
-   Building **sovereign AI infrastructure** (chips, data centres,
    cloud) to reduce dependency.\
-   Developing **regional AI governance frameworks**, possibly GCC-led.\
-   Establishing **public trust initiatives** through transparency,
    audits, and citizen engagement.\
-   Strengthening **cyber resilience** with AI-driven defence systems.

**Key takeaway:** The Middle East has momentum, but risks around talent,
trust, and technology sovereignty could slow its AI ambitions if not
addressed with urgency.
