# Defence & Security: AI and the Future of Regional Stability

The Middle East sits at the intersection of geopolitics, energy, and
global trade, making defence and security critical to national
strategies. AI is increasingly being deployed across surveillance, cyber
defence, autonomous systems, and threat detection. While it offers
unprecedented capabilities, it also raises urgent ethical and regulatory
questions.

### Surveillance and Public Safety

Several Middle Eastern states have invested in AI-driven surveillance
systems. In the UAE, smart cameras and facial recognition technologies
are deployed across airports, malls, and public spaces to enhance
safety. AI video analytics can identify suspicious behaviour in real
time, supporting faster law enforcement response.

Saudi Arabia is piloting AI-enabled crowd management systems,
particularly in Mecca during the Hajj, where millions of pilgrims
converge. These systems use AI to monitor density, predict congestion,
and reduce stampede risks.

### Cybersecurity

With the rise of digital infrastructure, AI-enabled cybersecurity has
become a priority. The Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority is
investing heavily in AI tools for real-time threat detection and
response. In the UAE, DarkMatter and CPX are developing AI-driven
platforms that analyse billions of data points daily to detect anomalies
and prevent attacks.

Regional financial institutions and energy companies are also adopting
AI-driven cyber defence, given their critical role in global markets.
Bahrain and Qatar are focusing on AI for fraud detection and securing
digital banking ecosystems.

### Autonomous Defence Systems

AI is transforming military capabilities. Israel, though outside the
GCC, is a global leader in autonomous drones and AI-enabled missile
defence systems, influencing regional competition. The UAE and Saudi
Arabia are both investing in AI-powered drones for surveillance and
border patrol. Autonomous naval systems are being tested to secure
shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Strait of Hormuz.

### Ethical and Geopolitical Concerns

The use of AI in defence raises pressing ethical concerns. Autonomous
weapons systems risk lowering the threshold for conflict by reducing
human decision-making in warfare. The absence of regional AI arms
control agreements amplifies these risks.

There is also a dependency on foreign technology providers. Much of the
advanced defence AI hardware and software comes from the US, China, and
Israel, raising sovereignty concerns for GCC states.

### Challenges

-   **Regulatory gaps:** Lack of international frameworks governing AI
    use in warfare.\
-   **Public trust:** Concerns over mass surveillance and erosion of
    privacy.\
-   **Talent gap:** Shortage of skilled AI engineers in defence compared
    to global players.

### What's Next

-   Growth of **AI-enabled border security**, including autonomous
    drones and ground robots.\
-   Expansion of **cyber AI command centres**, integrating threat
    intelligence across sectors.\
-   Increased focus on **AI ethics in defence**, with potential for
    GCC-led frameworks.\
-   Development of **sovereign defence AI platforms** to reduce reliance
    on foreign tech.

**Key takeaway:** AI is reshaping the security landscape of the Middle
East. While it enhances national defence and cybersecurity, it also
brings complex ethical, legal, and geopolitical challenges that must be
addressed.
