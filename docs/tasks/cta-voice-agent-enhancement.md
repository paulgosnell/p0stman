# CTA Voice Agent Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the CTAV3 component to include a voice agent option alongside the existing email form, providing users with two ways to get started.

## Implementation Summary

### File Modified
- `/src/components/v3/CTAV3.tsx`

### New Features Added

1. **Voice Agent Integration**
   - Added `useVoiceWaveform` hook from existing implementation
   - Integrated ElevenLabs voice agent with default agent ID
   - Uses same agent configuration as other sections

2. **UI Components Added**
   - "or" divider between email form and voice option
   - Voice agent button with microphone icon
   - Inline voice widget with:
     - Animated waveform visualization (60 bars)
     - Status indicators (Connecting/Listening/Speaking)
     - Close button to end conversation
     - Gradient background styling matching V3 design

3. **User Flow**
   - Default: Email form and "Try AI assistant" button visible
   - Click voice button â†’ Inline widget expands with waveform
   - Voice agent connects and shows real-time status
   - Users can close widget anytime to return to email form

### Design Highlights

- **Subtle Integration**: Voice option positioned as secondary alternative ("or" divider)
- **Professional Appearance**: Blue gradient background, smooth animations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Flexbox layout adapts to screen sizes
- **Consistent Branding**: Uses blue-600 accent color, light font weights
- **Clear Affordance**: Microphone icon + descriptive text "Prefer to talk? Try our AI assistant"

### Technical Details

**Dependencies Used:**
- `framer-motion` - Smooth animations for expand/collapse
- `@elevenlabs/react` - Voice conversation handling (via hook)
- `lucide-react` - Icon components (Mic, X, Volume2, Loader)

**State Management:**
- `isVoiceActive` - Controls widget visibility
- `voiceAgent` hook returns: isConnecting, isConnected, isSpeaking, frequencyData
- Email form state remains independent

**Waveform Visualization:**
- 60 vertical bars synced to audio frequency data
- Animates based on speaking state
- Min height 8% for visual consistency

## Usage

The voice agent will automatically use the `VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID` environment variable, falling back to the default agent ID if not set.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Voice button triggers agent connection
- [ ] Waveform animates during conversation
