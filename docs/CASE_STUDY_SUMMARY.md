## Typography Rules

### Font Sizes by Component
- **Hero Title**: 4xl (48px mobile) → 7xl (84px desktop)
- **Section Titles**: 5xl-7xl (48-84px)
- **Body Text**: lg-2xl (18-24px) with light weight
- **Stats Large**: 3xl-4xl (60-72px) in serif

### Line Heights Impact Content Capacity
- **Titles (1.1 tight)**: Wraps efficiently; best for 30-50 char text
- **Body (1.5 normal)**: Scannable; optimal for 80-200 char text
- **Large Body (2 relaxed)**: Maximum readability; supports 150-400 chars

## Responsive Considerations

### Mobile (< 640px)
- Fonts shrink 1-2 sizes
- Descriptions should stay under 100 characters for optimal wrapping
- Stats display in 2x2 grid
- Metadata wraps freely

### Tablet (640-1024px)
- Optimal zone for content balance
- 30-50 char titles and 150-250 char descriptions work perfectly
- Stats in 2-column or 4-column layouts

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Full font sizes displayed
- Can accommodate up to 200+ character descriptions
- 3-4 column stats grid

## Real Examples from Your Projects

### Mamori HealthOS
```
Hero Title: "Mamori HealthOS" (17 chars) ✓ Perfect
Hero Subtitle: "AI-Powered Health Operating System" (37 chars) ✓ Good
Hero Description: "Transforming fragmented health data..." (89 chars) ✓ Perfect
Challenge Description: "People are dying from confusion..." (218 chars) ✓ Perfect
Solution Description: Complex 45-word narrative (265 chars) ✓ Rich detail
```

### Luxury Travel Sweden
```
Hero Title: "Luxury Travel Sweden" (20 chars) ✓ Perfect
Challenge Description: "Luxury travel companies face a problem..." (216 chars) ✓ Perfect
Benefits Stat Description: "Changes that required developer intervention..." (113 chars) ✓ Optimal
```

### FAB Bank
```
Hero Title: "First Abu Dhabi Bank" (20 chars) ✓ Perfect
Metadata: "Banking & Finance" (17 chars), "18 months" (9 chars), "40+ experts" (11 chars) ✓ All good
Benefits Metric: "1 → 40+" (7 chars) ✓ Punchy
```

## Critical Observations

### What Works Well
1. **Serif fonts (Playfair Display)** for titles - gracefully handles wrapping
2. **Light font weight** - creates spacious reading experience, accommodates longer text
3. **Text shadows** on hero section - maintains readability over images
4. **Multi-sentence descriptions** - supports 250-400 character narratives naturally
5. **Magazine-style statistics** - large serif numbers with concise labels

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Titles over 50 characters (feels cramped even with serif)
2. Stats labels under 10 characters (becomes vague/ambiguous)
3. Approach steps over 140 characters (exceed single card width)
4. Benefit descriptions over 160 characters (overflow on mobile cards)
5. Challenge points over 150 characters (loses scanability)

## Advanced Tips

### For Small/Agile Projects
- Hero Title: Keep under 20 chars
- Challenge Points: Use only 3 instead of 4
- Benefits: Reduce to 3-4 stats instead of 6
- Approach Steps: Use 2-3 instead of 4

### For Enterprise Projects
- Hero Title: Can go up to 40 chars (still readable)
- Challenge Description: Use full 250 chars for detailed problem narrative
- Solution Description: Go to 400+ chars for architectural depth
- Benefits: Include full 6 stats with detailed descriptions
- Approach: Include all 4 steps + detailed context

### For AI/ML-Heavy Projects
- Emphasize: Model architectures, training data, inference speed, accuracy
- Technologies: Prioritize AI models (Claude, OpenAI, 11Labs, etc.)
- Features: Lead with AI capabilities (voice, vision, agents)
- Benefit Metrics: Focus on speed, accuracy, cost reduction
- Example Solution Description: "Built Claude 3.5 Sonnet Vision model integration with custom vector embeddings for semantic search across 10M+ health records with <500ms query latency and 94% accuracy."

## Typography Hierarchy for Copy

1. **Hero Title** (48-84px) - Leads with brand/project name
2. **Section Titles** (48-84px) - Each section has its own memorable headline
3. **Body Large** (20-24px) - Detailed descriptions with supporting context
4. **Stat Metrics** (60-72px) - Large numbers that catch the eye
5. **Stat Titles** (18px) - Benefits/achievements tied to metrics
6. **Body Regular** (14-18px) - Supporting details, tech stacks
7. **Labels** (12px) - Section labels, metadata

## Performance Notes

- **Longer descriptions perform better** than short ones - they demonstrate depth
- **Multiple sentences work well** - light font weight + relaxed line height support narrative
- **Specific numbers/metrics** resonate more than vague descriptions
- **Comparison statements** ("vs. traditional...") create impact
- **Statistics in benefit descriptions** (€5K, 95%, 300%, etc.) add credibility
