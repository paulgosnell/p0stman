# Executive Summary: AI in the Middle East 2025

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has moved from vision statements to
real-world deployment across the Middle East. Governments, sovereign
wealth funds, corporates, and startups are all converging on a shared
understanding: AI is not a "future technology" --- it is already
reshaping economies, cities, and societies today.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where We Are Now

-   The Middle East is one of the **fastest-growing AI regions in the
    world**, with GCC nations leading the charge.\
-   Landmark strategies like **UAE's National AI Strategy 2031** and
    **Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030** have positioned AI as a pillar of
    diversification.\
-   Investment is flowing: **\>\$20 billion pledged** across the GCC for
    AI by 2030.\
-   Adoption is accelerating across **healthcare, finance, energy,
    transport, and government services**.\
-   Public sentiment is cautiously optimistic: citizens see opportunity
    but fear job displacement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where We're Heading

-   By **2030, AI could contribute \$320 billion to the region's GDP**
    (PwC).\
-   Sovereign AI models and Arabic-language foundation models will
    emerge as key differentiators.\
-   Smart cities like **NEOM** will become global AI testbeds.\
-   AI will underpin **energy transition, healthcare transformation, and
    defence modernisation**.\
-   Workforce disruption is inevitable: up to **45% of jobs will be
    AI-augmented**, demanding urgent reskilling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Needs to Happen

-   Governments must double down on **AI education, governance, and
    infrastructure**.\
-   Businesses should act now, embedding AI pilots into operations while
    building long-term in-house capability.\
-   Investors should focus on **Arabic-first AI startups, energy-tech,
    and sovereign AI infrastructure**.\
-   Citizens must prepare for **AI-augmented living and working**,
    embracing literacy and adaptability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Risks to Manage

-   Talent shortages (60% of firms report hiring difficulties).\
-   Overdependence on foreign tech (chips, GPUs, foundational models).\
-   Public trust issues around jobs, privacy, and fairness.\
-   Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
