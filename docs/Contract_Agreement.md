## Syncing & Templates

### Synced Fields (from Client record)
- `client.name`
- `client.company_name`
- `client.address`
- `client.email`
- `client.company_number` (optional)

These fields should be pulled from the client record in the admin UI when creating or editing a contract and populated into the template. They should remain editable on a per-contract basis.

### Template Options

- **UK Template** (this document) — use English governing law, UK payment and VAT terms, and UK-specific contact/address formatting.
- **UAE Template** — use UAE governing law, UAE address/legal entity, and AED/USD currency guidance as required.

When creating a new contract in the admin UI, present a `Template` selector (`UK | UAE`). The chosen template sets defaults for governing law, provider address/legal entity, currency and payment terms. Client fields above are always synced into the chosen template.

If you want, I can also:
- Add logic to the admin UI to show the Template selector on `New Contract` and pre-fill provider defaults accordingly.
- Add a small backfill script to populate `provider_*` fields for existing contracts (using defaults or mappings you provide).
