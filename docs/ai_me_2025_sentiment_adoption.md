# Sentiment & Adoption Trends: How the Middle East Views AI

AI is not just a technological shift --- it's a cultural one. Public
perception, workforce readiness, and corporate adoption are shaping how
AI is embedded across the Middle East. Sentiment toward AI in the region
is a blend of optimism about opportunities, caution about risks, and
pragmatism in navigating rapid change.

### Public Sentiment

Surveys conducted by PwC and YouGov in 2024 show that over **70% of
respondents in the UAE and Saudi Arabia** believe AI will have a
positive impact on their daily lives. Younger generations (Gen Z and
millennials) are particularly optimistic, associating AI with improved
convenience, career opportunities, and quality of services.

At the same time, concerns remain. Around **40% of respondents**
expressed worries about job losses, while **35%** cited privacy risks.
Interestingly, Middle Eastern populations are generally more open to AI
adoption than their European counterparts, reflecting cultural
enthusiasm for technology and government-led innovation narratives.

### Corporate Adoption

According to IDC, AI spending in the Middle East and Africa reached
**\$3 billion in 2024**, with the GCC accounting for the bulk of
investments. Sectors leading adoption include financial services,
telecom, healthcare, and government. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are the
most advanced, with AI adoption rates in large enterprises exceeding
**50%**, compared to under 20% in many emerging markets.

Startups are also embracing AI, with Dubai's DIFC and Saudi's Fintech
Saudi reporting a surge in AI-first companies. Venture capital funding
for AI startups in MENA surpassed **\$500 million in 2024**, led by
fintech, logistics, and healthtech.

### Workforce Readiness

The Middle East is making significant investments in AI talent. The
Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in Abu
Dhabi is the world's first dedicated AI university, drawing students
globally. Saudi Arabia has launched AI scholarship programs and
bootcamps to retrain its workforce.

Still, the talent gap remains large. A World Economic Forum survey found
that **60% of companies in the GCC** report difficulties hiring
AI-skilled professionals. As a result, there is strong demand for
partnerships with global firms, as well as a push for sovereign AI
training programs in Arabic.

### Regional Differences

-   **UAE:** High optimism, strong government promotion, and a thriving
    AI startup scene.\
-   **Saudi Arabia:** Strong adoption in finance and energy, tied
    closely to Vision 2030 goals.\
-   **Qatar:** Focused on AI in sports and logistics, particularly ahead
    of major global events.\
-   **Bahrain & Oman:** Slower adopters, but building regulatory
    sandboxes to attract fintech and AI startups.

### Challenges

-   Public fears about displacement in lower-skilled jobs.\
-   Limited trust in AI decision-making in sensitive sectors (e.g.,
    healthcare, justice).\
-   Brain drain risk as AI talent migrates to global tech hubs.

### What's Next

-   Greater emphasis on **AI literacy programs** in schools and
    universities.\
-   Expansion of **Arabic-language AI platforms** to improve
    accessibility.\
-   Use of **citizen engagement platforms** to build trust and co-design
    AI policies.\
-   Growing role of **AI-powered HR and recruitment** to bridge talent
    gaps.

**Key takeaway:** Middle Eastern societies are broadly optimistic about
AI, but sustained adoption will require addressing fears about jobs and
privacy, while closing the talent gap with bold education and training
initiatives.
