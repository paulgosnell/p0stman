Summary
As a founder, builder and operator, I’ve been immersed in AI
product development long before the hype. I build with the latest AI
models every day, not to write blog posts, but to build actual working
software: production-grade platforms, SaaS tools, websites, and
MVPs.
Languages
English
I’m deeply immersed in the coding revolution - experimenting,
testing, and shaping what AI-first development looks like. Through
P0STMAN (my AI-powered agency), Chilled Tools (our suite of B2B
SaaS products) and working directly with the team at Bolt.new (the
fastest-growing AI builder on the planet), I’ve seen where this is all
going. There aren’t many people in the world building at this pace
with this level of exposure to the new world.
> I’m here to:
1. Launch AI-powered products at lightning speed
2. Share what’s working (and what’s not) in real-world AI builds
3. Help startups and innovation teams skip the noise and ship
-> Previous Wins:
- Scaled a digital agency from 1 to 30 people, delivering for IBM iX,
FAB, and Al Arabiya
- Launched Fitlink, a wellness app used in 30+ countries
- Built and shipped AI-first tools like Chilled CRM, CodeGen
accelerators, and more
--> My Focus Now:
1. CodeGen and vibe coding platforms
2. HealthTech, SportsTech & WellTech
3. Fractional product leadership for AI-native startups

Belong Interactive
Page 2 of 9
Director of Innovation & Growth | Full-Service Digital Agency
August 2024 - October 2024 (3 months)
Dubai, United Arab Emirates
As the Director of Innovation and Growth, I was brought in to help with
Belong's transformation into a premier strategic innovation agency in the
Middle East. I created a PlayBook for the agency to follow that would elevate
the brand, tone-of-voice, marketing and sales strategy. I spent half of my
assignment deeply embedded in the agency to truly get to know the services,
the projects and most importantly, the people. Belong will continue to be one
of the UAE's hidden gems in that its portfolio of clients and projects is typically
reserved for larger international agencies, not local boutique agencies.
Monstarlab
Product Leader | Full-Service Digital Agency
August 2023 - June 2024 (11 months)
Dubai, United Arab Emirates
I rejoined the agency I sold, which was acquired by Monstarlab, to help
manage and nurture a portfolio of digital products. The plan was to stand up
a load of ventures with the longer-term goal of becoming viable businesses
within their own rights. A portfolio of products would create a nice additional
revenue stream for the agency. Additionally, I would support people
and clients to help deliver projects. Due to my passion for HealthTech, I
supported the Health and Life Sciences vertical, prospecting and pitching for
HealthTech projects. Unfortunately, the company underwent an organisational
restructuring, which saw a huge percentage of the workforce let go, including
me.
Tent & Bear
Founder | Full-Service Digital Agency
September 2018 - August 2021 (3 years)
Dubai, United Arab Emirates
I founded the agency (called Tent & Bear, which later rebranded to
Genieology) on the back of a tonne of project work I was involved in. Large
corporations and consultancies in Dubai struggled to innovate and deliver,
so we were brought in as an innovation and delivery partner to help fix that
problem. The agency scaled quickly, growing from 1 to 30 contractors working
on various projects in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Morocco. We navigated a global
pandemic, adapted to remote-first working, and continued to win projects. The
agency was set up for success and growth, so of course, I sold it, returned
to the UK, took a few years off, and started a family. Monstar-Lab.com later
acquired the agency.

Fitlink
Founder @ Fitlink | Health & Fitness | B2B & B2C
October 2017 - October 2020 (3 years 1 month)
Norwich, England, United Kingdom
I built Fitlink to solve the problem of the disconnected world of activity trackers.
We all use different apps and devices to track our fitness—running, cycling,
swimming, hiking, or anything else. The problem is that we end up invisible to
each other, making staying connected tough.
Fitlink fixes that. You can connect your favourite apps, devices, and wearables
to Fitlink, which means you can share your fitness journey with friends, see
each other's stats like pace and distance, and build that sense of community
that keeps us all going. Plus, Fitlink is packed with features to encourage some
healthy competition—there's a points system and a rewards store where you
can spend your hard-earned points on real rewards.
Fitlink is free to download, with premium features if you want to take things
up a notch. It's not just another tracker—Fitlink makes fitness social, fun, and
rewarding.
IBM iX
Senior HealthTech Advisor & SME | IT Consultancy
June 2018 - February 2019 (9 months)
Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates
Got the old gang back together and headed back to the desert to go and get
some projects delivered! At the time IBM iX were struggling to get stuff out
the door so an opportunity presented itself where my team and I directed and
oversaw the delivery of projects. We would often manage offshore dev teams
and own QA and final sign-off. This hybrid delivery model worked well as IBM
got to offshore the bulk of the delivery (keeping costs down) but retain quality
with us. This pipeline of work warranted a new agency to be setup in Dubai.
See next role!
Projects included;
- A health and fitness mobile app for the Abu Dhabi Department of Health
- An Abu Dhabi airline online booking system
- A digital transformation project for the Abu Dhabi Government
Liftshare for Work
Page 4 of 9
Head of Growth | B2B Climate Tech Platform
March 2018 - June 2018 (4 months)
Norwich, UK
After a year of travelling, we returned to Norfolk, UK, and I spotted a role with
Liftshare and Ali, which I jumped on as such a cool business and team! I joined
to support the business development team in prospecting, pitching and closing
new business deals. I was involved in several big deals, repositioned and
created a new go-to-market sales and marketing strategy, and managed a
digital project in collaboration with Nesta to help connect community transport,
dial-a-rides, and community car schemes. My time at Liftshare was short but
valuable and enjoyable. The call of the desert was strong, and an opportunity I
couldn't turn down presented itself, so back to the sandpit we went!
GRAMPY
Technical Director | Full-Service Digital Agency
September 2013 - September 2016 (3 years 1 month)
London & Dubai
My team and I joined Grampy to support them on build and delivery. They
were predominantly a creative agency, so it was a great combination. After
successful collaborations and several large client wins, it made sense for
my team and I to join Grampy permanently. I joined the leadership team as
Technical Director, and my team joined and moved to London, too.
It was a rollercoaster ride of client wins and losses, which led to a small tech
audit in the UAE. This became a larger piece of work and opened up several
more opportunities. It made sense to have a base there, so I led the expansion
into the ME, set up and registered a business in Dubai, and became the MENA
Regional Manager and Technical Director.
Some huge projects were delivered, and a reputation was quickly built for
ourselves, but I was feeling burnt out. The constant travelling from Norfolk to
London to Dubai every week was taking its toll. So when the final project I was
managing was delivered, I waved farewell to Grampy and set off for a year of
travels with my wife.
Nearby Deals
Founder | Rewards App & Loyalty Platform
February 2011 - January 2014 (3 years)
Norwich, UK
Nearby Deals was a location-based deal app that connects high-street
shoppers with local independent stores via exclusive deals and offers. I got
Page 5 of 9
frustrated with the daily deal and online voucher code websites and wanted
something on my phone that sent me deals and offers as I was out on the high
street shopping - the ideal time to get a deal! I did some research and chatted
to high-street stores, confirmed they had quiet days/times whereby they’d want
to offer a deal to generate footfall and sales. And, of course, everyone wants to
save money while shopping and eating. So a no-brainer I thought!
Unfortunately, I spent too much time designing and building the perfect product
before launching. I invested heavily in design and development, banners,
bikes, T-shirts, fleeces, hats, stickers, beautifully designed brochures, amazing
flyers, signage, sponsorships, hosting, online services, office space, etc. You
name it, we had it! We redesigned the app twice before we even went live!!
But what I didn’t do was launch an MVP and test the water. To learn from
users. Gather feedback and update the product. Find product market fit. Keep
things lean and cost-effective.
So, nearly two years after I launched, I ran out of runway, had no marketing
budget, and struggled to gain traction. This lesson was a hard and expensive,
and I’ll never do it again!
Whatonline
Founder | Full-Service Digital Agency
October 2007 - January 2014 (6 years 4 months)
Norwich, UK
Whatonline started as me, a freelancer in Norwich, picking up a good selection
of projects and clients that warranted leaving the freelancer scene and starting
my first agency. Freelancing at agencies in Norwich and London meant I
was introduced to the service industry, whereby you sell time (services), not
products. Up to this point, I was used to buying something for X and selling it
for Y. So selling time with minimal costs was an eye-opener. I built up a good
reputation and had a solid pipeline of work and a decent selection of retainers,
which meant I was running a boutique-style digital services agency. Due to
me being a developer, many of the projects we were involved in were more
technical than creative. We often partnered with creative agencies who needed
their creative work delivered. Towards the end, this became our sweet spot,
and eventually, we permanently partnered with a creative agency in London,
and Whatonline was shut down.
Magic Online Solutions
Page 6 of 9
Account Manager | Full-Service Digital Agency
August 2008 - July 2010 (2 years)
Norwich, UK
I joined the agency as a freelance web developer and supported the dev team
on front-end builds and eshot templates—proper old-school HTML and CSS.
I was involved in a few client-facing meetings and found it easier to articulate
what the client wanted in agency or developer language, so I was soon given
the dual role of developer and account manager. In this role, I supported
many web projects, building client relationships, spotting upsell or cross-sell
opportunities, creating additional revenue for the agency, and keeping clients
happy and returning for more. My entrepreneurial itch kicked in, and I liked the
idea of running my own agency, but first, I needed to build up a decent portfolio
of clients. I left the agency with support from the founder, with whom I’m still
friends today and it was this role that pivoted me into agency life.
Soup
Developer | Full-Service Digital Agency
September 2009 - November 2009 (3 months)
Norwich, UK
My first real gig as a freelance dev. Soup was the biggest and best agency in
Norwich at the time so was chuffed to get some large agency experience early
on in my career. I worked on several builds supporting the dev team in building
HTML templates.
UK Trackdays
Event Manager (Founder) | Event Management Company
October 2004 - October 2007 (3 years 1 month)
Norwich, UK
After running Trackdays for the biggest motorsport and track day company in
the UK (MSV) and then setting up from scratch what turned into the biggest
track day company in the UK (trackdays.co.uk), it seemed I was well prepared
to set up and run my own track day company!
Supported by some designer and developer friends I’d met prior, I started
building a track day and gift experience e-commerce website. It was a huge
but enjoyable learning curve from a blank canvas to a live website taking
orders. After going live, I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t selling anything.
Is just launching a website enough? This is where I discovered what is now
known as SEO or Search, and soon after PPC or Paid, I became obsessed
with attracting and acquiring traffic and converting them into customers. I
learned the hard way for years, but eventually, I created a very successful
Page 7 of 9
online business that made more sales per day than I could manage. I focused
on streamlining processes and keeping things simple as I didn’t want to
employ a team of people to do what I knew technology could do.
I stupidly diversified the cash-rich business and invested in other business
opportunities, including business properties (the developer went bust) and
importing motorbikes, quads and buggies from China. The business property
wasn’t built, a container of stock arrived, and I had nowhere or no way of
selling it. By the time I did, the market was flooded with the same bikes, and
I struggled to sell them. We ran out of cash and couldn’t continue to trade
across any of the business lines, so it crashed around me, and I was forced
to liquidate the company: these were very, very sad times and many, many
lessons learned.
Trackdays
Event Manager | Event Management Company
October 2003 - October 2004 (1 year 1 month)
Braintree, Essex, UK
- Created a new Trackday business for a Trackday enthusiast who wanted to
run their Club.

Marketing teams to direct and manage the design and build of a new website.
- The website was designed to promote, market and advertise car and bike
Trackdays and Gift Experiences in the UK, and it became the number one car
and bike Trackday Club/business in the UK.
- This experience inspired me to set up my own Trackday Club and start my
first business.
